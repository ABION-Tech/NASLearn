For securely managing logins, passwords, and access to your LMS hosted on GitHub, using only front-end technologies like JavaScript, you'll run into security limitations. Storing sensitive data (like passwords) directly in client-side code is not secure. However, there are some creative, low-cost ways to secure an LMS for a small cohort of students without using a full back-end like Firebase yet.

### **Option 1: Use Firebase for Authentication (Recommended for Scalability)**
Even though you're not ready to implement a full back-end yet, Firebase Authentication is a lightweight, secure option that could still work in your scenario. Firebase provides robust user management, including:

- **User sign-up/sign-in** with email/password
- **Password reset and changes**
- **Secure token-based authentication**
  
Since Firebase is a front-end friendly platform, you can integrate it easily into your GitHub Pages-hosted LMS without needing to manage a separate back-end. Once you build the authentication system with Firebase, you can later scale it when you're ready to build more advanced features.

#### Steps for Firebase Authentication:
1. **Set up Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, and enable the **Authentication** service.
   - Choose **Email/Password** authentication in the sign-in methods.

2. **Install Firebase SDK:**
   - In your LMS, include Firebase SDK via `<script>` tags in your HTML files.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <!-- Firebase App (the core Firebase SDK) -->
   <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.10.0/firebase-app.js"></script>

   <!-- Firebase Authentication -->
   <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.10.0/firebase-auth.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in your JavaScript:**
   ```javascript
   // Initialize Firebase
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const auth = firebase.auth();
   ```

4. **Create Sign-In and Sign-Up Forms:**
   - Use Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` for sign-up and `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` for sign-in.
   - You can create these forms in simple HTML and JS, then use Firebase's methods to manage users.

   Example for **sign-up**:
   ```javascript
   const signUp = () => {
       const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
       const password = document.getElementById('password').value;
       firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
           .then((userCredential) => {
               console.log("User signed up: ", userCredential.user);
           })
           .catch((error) => {
               console.error("Error signing up: ", error.message);
           });
   }
   ```

5. **Password Reset/Change Functionality:**
   Firebase allows easy password reset emails and password changes from the user's dashboard.

### **Option 2: GitHub + JavaScript + LocalStorage (Temporary & Low Security)**
If you're not comfortable using Firebase yet and need a quick, temporary solution, you can build a simple login system using **JavaScript and LocalStorage**. This is *not secure* for production or real-world use with sensitive data, but it could work for your first cohort.

#### How it works:
1. **Store Users Locally:**
   You can store a list of user credentials (hashed passwords) in LocalStorage. When a user signs up, the credentials are saved locally. For sign-in, you'd check the stored values against what the user enters.

2. **Password Hashing:**
   Use a simple hashing function like **SHA-256** to hash the passwords before storing them, although this is still vulnerable on the client-side.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   const hashPassword = (password) => {
       return CryptoJS.SHA256(password).toString();
   };
   ```

3. **Login Logic:**
   Check if the entered login credentials match what's stored in LocalStorage.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const login = () => {
       const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
       const password = hashPassword(document.getElementById('password').value);
       const storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(email));
       
       if (storedUser && storedUser.password === password) {
           alert("Login successful");
           // Redirect to the LMS dashboard or set session
       } else {
           alert("Invalid credentials");
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Limitations:**
   - **Security**: LocalStorage is easily accessible through browser DevTools, so users could see or change data, which is a big concern for sensitive info.
   - **Scalability**: LocalStorage isn't ideal for a real-world LMS with multiple students, as you can't share data across different browsers or devices.

### **Option 3: Google OAuth (Login with Google)**
If you're comfortable with Google Sign-In, you can also use **Google OAuth** to authenticate users without managing passwords directly. It's another lightweight, easy-to-implement solution, and it integrates well with Firebase for future expansion.

#### Steps:
1. **Set up Google API Console**:
   - Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), create a new project, and enable the **Google+ API** or **Google Identity API** for OAuth.

2. **Include Google Sign-In Button**:
   - Add the following button to your HTML:
   ```html
   <div class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn"></div>
   ```

3. **Handle Sign-In via Google**:
   Add JavaScript to handle the sign-in response.
   ```javascript
   function onSignIn(googleUser) {
       var profile = googleUser.getBasicProfile();
       console.log('ID: ' + profile.getId());
       console.log('Name: ' + profile.getName());
       console.log('Email: ' + profile.getEmail());
   }
   ```

This method uses Google for sign-in and authentication, which is secure and reliable.

### **Recommendation: Firebase for Scalability & Security**
Given your needs, I would recommend starting with **Firebase Authentication** because it's free for small-scale projects, scalable, and secure. It's much more robust than JavaScript and LocalStorage solutions. You can manage user authentication, reset passwords, and protect your LMS without building a full back-end system.

Once you integrate Firebase, you can focus on course content, quizzes, and other front-end aspects, knowing that your student authentication is secure. Let me know if you'd like a step-by-step guide on Firebase, and I'll help you with the process.
