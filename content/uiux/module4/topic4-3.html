            <div class="consistency-in-design section">
                <h2>Consistency in Design</h2>
                <p><strong>Consistency</strong> is a fundamental principle in UI/UX design. It refers to the use of
                    consistent elements, such as color schemes, typography, and layouts, throughout a product or
                    service. Consistency helps to create a cohesive and familiar user experience, making it easier for
                    users to navigate and interact with the product.</p>

                <h3>Key Elements of Consistency:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color Schemes:</strong> Using a consistent color palette throughout the design
                        establishes visual harmony and brand identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Selecting consistent fonts, sizes, and styles across all platforms
                        ensures readability and visual coherence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Implementing a consistent layout structure for different pages or
                        screens aids in user familiarity and ease of use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iconography:</strong> Utilizing consistent icons and symbols enhances recognition and
                        quick comprehension of functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branding:</strong> Maintaining a consistent brand identity through logos, colors, and
                        typography reinforces brand presence and trust.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Benefits of Consistency:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Consistent design elements make it easier for users
                        to navigate and understand the product, leading to a smoother user journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Brand Recognition:</strong> A cohesive brand identity fosters familiarity,
                        which builds trust and loyalty among users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Utilizing consistent design elements can streamline the
                        design process and reduce development time, as designers can reuse established components.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="example">
                    <strong>Real-World Example:</strong>
                    <p>Apple is known for its consistent design language across its products, from iPhones to MacBooks.
                        This consistency creates a unified and familiar user experience, making it easier for users to
                        switch between devices seamlessly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="design-standards-and-systems section">
                <h2>Design Standards and Systems</h2>
                <p><strong>Design standards</strong> are a set of guidelines that define how design elements should be
                    used within a product or organization. <strong>Design systems</strong> are collections of reusable
                    components, patterns, and guidelines that help teams create consistent and scalable designs.</p>

                <h3>Key Components of Design Systems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Atomic Design:</strong> A methodology for breaking down design elements into smaller,
                        reusable components, facilitating easier updates and scalability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Style Guides:</strong> A document that outlines the rules for using color, typography,
                        and other design elements, providing a reference point for designers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Component Libraries:</strong> A collection of reusable design components, such as
                        buttons, icons, and input fields, which enhances design consistency across products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern Libraries:</strong> A collection of common design patterns, such as navigation
                        menus, forms, and cards, which can be reused in various applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Benefits of Design Systems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Design systems streamline the design process by providing
                        reusable components and established guidelines, saving time and resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> They help ensure consistency across different products and
                        platforms, reinforcing brand identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design systems can be easily scaled to accommodate new features or
                        products, ensuring future growth is manageable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Design systems facilitate collaboration between designers,
                        developers, and other stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Real-World Example:</strong>
                    <p>Google's Material Design system provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and components for
                        designing Android apps. This system helps developers create consistent and visually appealing
                        apps that adhere to Google's design principles, making the user experience intuitive and
                        cohesive.</p>
