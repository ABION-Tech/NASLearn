            <h2>Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
            <p>Prototyping is a crucial step in the design process, enabling teams to visualize and test their concepts.
                Prototypes can be classified into two main categories: low-fidelity and high-fidelity.</p>

            <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototypes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Definition:</span> Basic, non-interactive representations of a product that
                    focus on the overall structure and layout.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Purpose:</span> Used for early-stage testing, concept validation, and
                    gathering feedback on the overall design.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Examples:</span> Paper sketches, wireframes, click-through prototypes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Definition:</span> Detailed, interactive representations of a product that
                    closely resemble the final design.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Purpose:</span> Used for testing specific interactions, evaluating
                    usability, and presenting to stakeholders.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Examples:</span> Interactive prototypes created using tools like Figma,
                    Adobe XD, or InVision.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When to Use Each</h2>
            <p>Choosing between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes depends on the stage of the design process and
                the specific goals of the testing.</p>

            <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototypes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Early-Stage Testing:</span> When exploring different concepts and gathering
                    initial feedback.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Iterative Design:</span> For quickly testing and iterating on different
                    ideas.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Limited Resources:</span> When time or budget is limited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototypes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Detailed Testing:</span> For evaluating specific interactions and usability
                    issues.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Stakeholder Presentation:</span> To present the final design to stakeholders
                    and obtain approval.</li>
                <li><span class="important">User Testing:</span> For conducting in-depth usability tests with potential
                    users.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
            <p>Prototyping is essential across various design domains. Here’s how low-fidelity and high-fidelity
                prototypes are applied in real-world scenarios:</p>

            <h3>Mobile App Design:</h3>
            <p>Low-fidelity prototypes can be used to test the overall layout and structure of an app, while
                high-fidelity prototypes can be used to evaluate specific interactions, such as swiping, tapping, and
                scrolling.</p>

            <h3>Website Design:</h3>
            <p>Low-fidelity prototypes can be used to test the navigation and information architecture of a website,
                while high-fidelity prototypes can be used to evaluate the visual design and user experience.</p>

            <h3>Product Design:</h3>
            <p>Low-fidelity prototypes can be used to explore different design concepts, while high-fidelity prototypes
                can be used to test the product's functionality and usability.</p>

            <p>By utilizing both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes throughout the design process, teams can
                ensure that their products meet user needs and are both functional and visually appealing. This approach
                facilitates better communication among team members and with stakeholders, ultimately leading to more
                successful design outcomes.</p>
