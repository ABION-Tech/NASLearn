            <h2>Introduction to Wireframes</h2>
            <p><span class="important">Definition:</span> Wireframes are simplified, low-fidelity representations of a
                user interface (UI) that focus on layout, structure, and functionality. They are typically created using
                simple shapes, lines, and text to represent elements such as buttons, navigation menus, and content
                areas.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Wireframing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Early-Stage Feedback:</span> Wireframes allow for early-stage feedback from
                    stakeholders and users, helping to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Focus on Structure:</span> Wireframes help designers focus on the overall
                    structure and layout of the UI, rather than getting bogged down in details like color and
                    typography.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Efficient Iteration:</span> Wireframes are easy to modify and iterate on,
                    allowing designers to experiment with different layouts and features.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Cost-Effective:</span> Wireframes are less expensive to create than
                    high-fidelity prototypes, making them a valuable tool for testing ideas and concepts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Low-Fidelity Wireframes:</span> Simple sketches or diagrams that outline the
                    basic structure and layout of the UI.</li>
                <li><span class="important">High-Fidelity Wireframes:</span> More detailed wireframes that include
                    specific information about elements such as size, placement, and interactions.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Wireframing Tools:</span> Software tools that can be used to create
                    wireframes, such as Balsamiq, Figma, and Sketch.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Best Practices for Wireframing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Start with Low-Fidelity Wireframes:</span> Begin by creating simple sketches
                    or diagrams to focus on the overall layout and structure.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Iterate and Refine:</span> Continuously refine your wireframes based on
                    feedback and testing.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Involve Stakeholders:</span> Get feedback from stakeholders early in the
                    process to ensure that the wireframes align with business goals and user needs.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Prioritize Functionality:</span> Focus on the core functionality of the UI,
                    rather than on aesthetics.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Keep it Simple:</span> Avoid cluttering your wireframes with unnecessary
                    details.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Use Consistent Terminology:</span> Use consistent terminology throughout
                    your wireframes to avoid confusion.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Annotate Wireframes:</span> Add notes or annotations to explain the purpose
                    of different elements.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Consider User Flow:</span> Map out the user's journey through the UI to
                    ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
            <p>When designing a new mobile app, a wireframe might be used to visualize the layout of the home screen,
                navigation menu, and product pages. By creating wireframes, designers can test different layouts and
                features to ensure that the app is easy to use and meets the needs of the target audience.</p>
