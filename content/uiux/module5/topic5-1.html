            <h2>5.1 Interaction Design Fundamentals</h2>

            <h3>Designing for Interactivity</h3>
            <p><strong>Interaction design</strong> is the practice of designing digital products, environments, systems,
                and services that are intuitive, engaging, and effective for users. It focuses on how users interact
                with a product, considering factors such as affordances, feedback, and visibility.</p>

            <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Affordances:</strong> How design elements suggest their use. For example, a button's
                    appearance suggests that it can be clicked.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The visual, auditory, or haptic responses that a product provides to user
                    actions. For example, a confirmation message or sound effect after completing a task.</li>
                <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> The ability of users to easily find and understand the elements of a
                    product.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Significance of Interaction Design:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Well-designed interactions make products easier to use
                    and more enjoyable.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> Interactive elements can encourage users to explore and
                    engage with a product.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Frustration:</strong> Clear and intuitive interactions can help to reduce user
                    frustration and improve satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <p>Social media apps like Instagram use a variety of interactive elements, such as buttons, icons, and
                gestures, to allow users to like, comment, and share content. These interactions are designed to be
                intuitive and easy to understand, making the app enjoyable to use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Interactive Prototypes</h3>
            <p><strong>Interactive prototypes</strong> are functional models of a design that simulate how users will
                interact with the final product. They are used to test and refine the user experience before development
                begins.</p>

            <h4>Tools for Creating Interactive Prototypes:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Figma:</strong> A popular cloud-based design tool that offers powerful prototyping features.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Adobe XD:</strong> A versatile design tool that includes features for creating interactive
                    prototypes.</li>
                <li><strong>InVision:</strong> A specialized prototyping tool that focuses on creating high-fidelity
                    prototypes and conducting user testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Framer:</strong> A code-based prototyping tool that offers advanced customization options.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Principle:</strong> A simple and intuitive prototyping tool that is ideal for creating basic
                    interactions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Significance of Interactive Prototypes:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Early Feedback:</strong> Prototypes allow stakeholders to provide feedback on the design
                    before development begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing Usability:</strong> Prototypes can be used to test the usability of a product and
                    identify potential issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Prototypes can help to communicate design ideas to stakeholders and
                    team members.</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Prototypes can be easily modified and iterated on to refine the design.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <p>A team designing a new e-commerce website might create an interactive prototype to allow users to browse
                products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process. This prototype would help the team
                identify any usability issues and make necessary improvements before launching the final product.</p>
