                    <h3>1. Augmented Reality (AR)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the
                        user's perception of reality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immersive Experiences:</strong> AR creates a sense of immersion by blending digital
                            and physical elements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> AR allows users to interact with digital content in a natural
                            way.</li>
                        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> AR is used in various industries, including gaming,
                            education, retail, and marketing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> AR is becoming increasingly prevalent and offers new opportunities
                        for designers to create innovative and engaging experiences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Pokémon Go, a popular AR game, allows users to capture
                        virtual Pokémon in the real world.</p>

                <div class="list-group-item">
                    <h3>2. Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> VR creates a fully immersive, computer-generated environment that
                        simulates the real world.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immersion:</strong> VR provides a deep sense of presence and engagement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> VR requires users to interact with the virtual world using
                            controllers or other input devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> VR is used in gaming, education, training, and entertainment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> VR is rapidly expanding and offers new possibilities for designers
                        to create immersive and engaging experiences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are used for
                        gaming, virtual tours, and training simulations.</p>
