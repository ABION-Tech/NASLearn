        <p>This module delves into how user research informs design decisions and the process of creating user personas
            to represent target audiences.</p>

            <h2>Topic 2: Creating Personas</h2>

            <h4>What Are Personas?</h4>
            <p>Personas are <strong>fictional characters</strong> created from user research to represent distinct
                segments of the target audience. These personas help teams empathize with users and make design
                decisions that are better aligned with real user needs. By using personas, designers can better
                understand the challenges, goals, and behaviors of the people they are designing for, leading to more
                user-centered and successful product designs.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="my-4">
            <h4>Components of a Persona:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name and Photo:</strong> Humanizing the persona with a relatable identity allows design
                    teams to emotionally connect with the user they represent. Including a name, a photo, or avatar
                    makes it easier to imagine real users rather than abstract concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> These provide context about the persona, such as age, gender,
                    location, occupation, and education level. This information helps create realistic and
                    representative profiles that guide design decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Goals and Challenges:</strong> A persona's goals define what they want to achieve using the
                    product, while their challenges illustrate the barriers they face in achieving those goals.
                    Identifying these helps ensure that the product design addresses user needs effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns and Preferences:</strong> These include daily routines, preferences,
                    frustrations, and the tools the persona uses. Understanding the persona’s behavior ensures that the
                    design fits into their lifestyle and addresses their preferences, improving overall usability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example Persona:</h4>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sarah</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 34</p>
            <p><strong>Location:</strong> New York</p>

            <h5>Goals:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Discover eco-friendly products online that align with her values.</li>
                <li>Simplify her shopping experience, ensuring it’s quick and intuitive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Challenges:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Struggles with navigating complex e-commerce platforms that offer an overwhelming variety of
                    options.</li>
                <li>Finds it hard to differentiate between genuinely sustainable products and those that are merely
                    marketed as such.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This persona represents a user segment that values sustainability and is tech-savvy but feels frustrated
                with the lack of transparency in the e-commerce space. Understanding Sarah’s goals and challenges helps
                in designing a more user-friendly, intuitive platform that makes it easy for her to find sustainable
                products and navigate the shopping process.</p>
