        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Introduction to Responsive Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Responsive design</strong> is a design approach that ensures a website or application adapts
                seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience across various
                platforms.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Responsive designs use flexible layouts that adjust to the user's
                    device and screen size.</li>
                <li><strong>Viewport:</strong> The visible area of a webpage on a device.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS rules that allow for different styles to be applied based on the
                    device's viewport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Significance of Responsive Design:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Responsive design ensures a consistent and enjoyable
                    experience across all devices, leading to increased user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Responsive design makes it easier for users with disabilities to
                    access and use websites and applications.</li>
                <li><strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Search engines often rank responsive websites higher in search
                    results, as they provide a better user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Real-World Example:</h3>
            <p>E-commerce websites like Amazon and eBay use responsive design to ensure that their products and content
                are displayed optimally on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This allows users to shop and browse
                products seamlessly across different devices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Fluid Grids and Media Queries</h2>

            <h3>Fluid Grids:</h3>
            <p>Fluid grids use percentage-based widths for layout elements, allowing them to scale proportionally to the
                screen size. This creates a flexible and adaptable layout that works well on various devices.</p>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <pre><code>
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.image {
  width: 40%;
  float: left;
}

.text {
  width: 60%;
  float: right;
}
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Media Queries:</h3>
            <p>Media queries allow designers to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as
                screen width, height, orientation, and other factors.</p>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <pre><code>
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .image {
    width: 100%;
    float: none;
  }

  .text {
    width: 100%;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>This media query applies specific styles to the image and text elements when the screen width is less
                than or equal to 768 pixels, ensuring a suitable layout for smaller screens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By using fluid grids and media queries, designers can create responsive websites that provide a
                consistent and enjoyable user experience across all devices. Responsive design not only enhances
                usability but also supports the growth of a brand by ensuring accessibility and engagement across
                platforms.</p>
