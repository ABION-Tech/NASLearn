            <p>In this section, we will recap what we learned in Week 1 and provide a preview of what to expect in Week
                2 of our UI/UX design course.</p>

            <h2>Recap of Week 1</h2>
            <p>This week introduced the core concepts of UI and UX design, emphasizing the importance of both in
                creating user-centered products. We explored the design process, focusing on user-centered design and
                the Double Diamond model.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core Concepts of UI and UX:</strong> We learned that UI (User Interface) focuses on the
                    aesthetic aspects of a product, while UX (User Experience) concerns itself with the overall feel and
                    usability.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> This approach puts the user's needs and experiences at the
                    forefront of the design process, ensuring that the product is both functional and enjoyable.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Diamond Model:</strong> We explored this model, which outlines the stages of design
                    from discovering user needs to defining problems and developing solutions. This iterative process
                    allows for ongoing feedback and improvement.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="preview-item">
            <h2>Preview of Week 2</h2>
            <p>Next week, we will dive deeper into <strong>User Research and Personas</strong>. This week is crucial as
                it lays the foundation for understanding your users more comprehensively. Here’s what we will cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Research Techniques:</strong> Learn how to conduct effective interviews, surveys, and
                    observations to gather valuable insights into users' needs and behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyzing and Synthesizing Data:</strong> Discover methods for analyzing user research data
                    to identify patterns and insights that inform your design decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating User Personas:</strong> We will explore how to create detailed user personas that
                    represent different segments of your target audience. These personas will guide the design process
                    and help ensure that your solutions align with users’ expectations and needs.</li>
