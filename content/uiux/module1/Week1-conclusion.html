            <h1>6. Common Misconceptions</h1>
            <p>Understanding the common misconceptions surrounding UI and UX design is crucial for effective learning
                and practice. Below are some prevalent myths, along with clarifications to help distinguish between
                them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="misconception-item">
            <h2>Misconception 1: UX and UI are the same</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Clarification:</strong>
                <p>UX (User Experience) focuses on the user's journey and how the product works, encompassing all
                    interactions a user has with a product. It’s about optimizing the overall experience to ensure it is
                    intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. In contrast, UI (User Interface) is concerned with how the
                    product looks and feels. It deals with the visual aspects, including layout, colors, typography, and
                    interactive elements.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="misconception-item">
            <h2>Misconception 2: Good UI automatically means good UX</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Clarification:</strong>
                <p>A visually appealing product (UI) does not always function well (UX). Good UI can attract users, but
                    if the functionality is poor or the navigation is confusing, the overall user experience will
                    suffer. For a product to be successful, both UI and UX must work together seamlessly. Designers need
                    to ensure that the interface is not only attractive but also user-friendly and efficient.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="misconception-item">
            <h2>Misconception 3: The design process is linear</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Clarification:</strong>
                <p>The design process is iterative, meaning it involves constant testing, feedback, and improvements.
                    It’s a cycle of prototyping, testing, and refining until the final product meets user needs and
                    expectations. Designers often revisit earlier stages based on feedback received during user testing
                    to make necessary adjustments and enhance the product's usability and appeal.</p>
