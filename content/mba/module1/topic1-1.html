            <h2>The Role of Businesses in the Economy</h2>
            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            <p>
                Businesses are the backbone of economies, generating goods and services, creating jobs, and driving
                economic growth. They contribute to GDP, innovation, and social well-being.
            </p>
            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <div class="real-world-example">
                Consider <strong>Apple Inc.</strong>. It not only produces valuable consumer products but also
                contributes significantly to the global economy through job creation, technology advancement, and
                corporate taxation.
            </div>
            <h4>Significance:</h4>
            <p>
                Understanding the broader role of businesses in the economy helps future business leaders recognize
                their impact on society, the importance of ethical business practices, and the value of sustainable
                growth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Business Entities and Structures</h2>
            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            <p>
                Businesses can take different forms, each with distinct legal and operational implications. Key types
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sole Proprietorship:</strong> A business owned by a single individual with unlimited
                    liability.</li>
                <li><strong>Partnership:</strong> A business owned by two or more individuals who share profits, losses,
                    and liabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporation:</strong> A legal entity separate from its owners, offering limited liability to
                    shareholders.</li>
                <li><strong>LLC (Limited Liability Company):</strong> A hybrid structure offering the benefits of both a
                    corporation and a partnership.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <div class="real-world-example">
                Amazon started as a sole proprietorship but later transitioned to a corporation as it grew, benefiting
                from limited liability and the ability to raise capital through the stock market.
            </div>
            <h4>Significance:</h4>
            <p>
                Choosing the right business structure is crucial for legal protection, tax benefits, and operational
                efficiency.
            </p>
