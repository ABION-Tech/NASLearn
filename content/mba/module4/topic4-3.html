            <h2>Time Value of Money (TVM)</h2>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            <p>The concept that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential
                earning capacity. TVM is the foundation of investment decision-making.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present Value (PV):</strong> The value of future cash flows discounted back to today.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Value (FV):</strong> The value of an investment after earning interest over time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discounting and Compounding:</strong> Central to determining present and future value.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Play a critical role in calculating TVM.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Real-World Example:</h3>
            <p>Choosing between receiving $10,000 today or $10,000 in two years highlights the TVM principle. Todayâ€™s
                $10,000 could be invested, earning interest and growing over time.</p>
            <h3>Significance:</h3>
            <p>Understanding TVM ensures sound investment decisions and capital budgeting.</p>

            <h2>Capital Budgeting Techniques</h2>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            <p>Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating investment projects to determine their worth. Two key
                methods are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Calculates the present value of cash flows from an
                    investment, subtracting the initial cost. A positive NPV indicates a good investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> The discount rate that makes the NPV of a project
                    zero. If the IRR exceeds the required rate of return, the project is considered favorable.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Real-World Example:</h3>
            <p>A company deciding whether to build a new factory would use NPV and IRR to evaluate the long-term
                profitability of the project.</p>
            <h3>Significance:</h3>
            <p>These techniques help businesses make informed decisions about which projects to pursue, ensuring
                investments are aligned with financial goals.</p>
