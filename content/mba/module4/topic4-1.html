            <h2>Understanding the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement</h2>
            <p>Financial statements provide a summary of a company's financial position and performance. They are
                essential tools for decision-making by investors, management, and other stakeholders.</p>
            <h3>Balance Sheet:</h3>
            <p>A snapshot of the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity at a specific point in time. It
                follows the equation:
                <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Income Statement:</h3>
            <p>Shows the company’s revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period, providing insight into
                operational performance. It helps measure profitability.</p>

            <h3>Cash Flow Statement:</h3>
            <p>Reports the cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing activities, highlighting
                liquidity and how cash is generated or used.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-concepts">
            <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
            <ul>

                    expenses, and net income.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Breaks down into operating, investing, and financing
                    activities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                and cash reserves (current assets). Its liabilities consist of loans and bond obligations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="significance">
            <h2>Significance:</h2>

                health of an organization. Understanding them is critical for making informed business decisions.</p>
