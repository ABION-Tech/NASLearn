        <div class="question">
            <h2>1. How do the three financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement)
                provide complementary insights into a company’s financial health?</h2>
            <p>The balance sheet offers a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific time, helping to
                assess financial stability. The income statement provides a summary of revenues and expenses, indicating
                profitability over a period. The cash flow statement tracks cash inflows and outflows, showing how well
                a company manages its liquidity. Together, these statements allow stakeholders to evaluate overall
                financial health comprehensively.</p>

            <h2>2. Can ratio analysis ever be misleading? What are some limitations of using ratios to evaluate company
                performance?</h2>
            <p>Yes, ratio analysis can be misleading due to various factors. Ratios may not account for differences in
                accounting policies or industry standards. They also rely on historical data, which might not accurately
                reflect future performance. Moreover, ratios can be manipulated through accounting practices, leading to
                distorted insights. It's essential to use ratios in conjunction with qualitative factors and broader
                context for a comprehensive evaluation.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>3. Discuss how the concept of the time value of money can affect personal financial decisions, such as
                taking out a loan or investing in a savings account.</h2>
            <p>The time value of money (TVM) emphasizes that money today is worth more than the same amount in the
                future due to its earning potential. For instance, when considering a loan, understanding TVM can help
                individuals recognize the true cost of borrowing over time. Similarly, investing in a savings account
                with interest can yield greater returns, reinforcing the importance of making timely financial decisions
                that capitalize on this principle.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>4. In what ways can a company’s risk management strategies help it navigate financial crises or economic
                downturns?</h2>
            <p>Effective risk management strategies, such as diversification of assets, maintaining liquidity reserves,
                and employing hedging techniques, can enhance a company's resilience during financial crises. By
                identifying potential risks and preparing mitigation plans, companies can adapt more quickly to changing
                conditions, minimize losses, and sustain operations through downturns. This proactive approach can also
                build stakeholder confidence during challenging times.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>5. How can forecasting improve a company’s ability to adapt to market changes? What happens when
                forecasts are significantly inaccurate?</h2>
            <p>Forecasting allows companies to anticipate market trends, demand fluctuations, and potential challenges.
                By having data-driven predictions, businesses can make informed strategic decisions regarding resource
                allocation, inventory management, and pricing strategies. However, when forecasts are significantly
                inaccurate, companies may face overproduction, understocking, or misallocated resources, which can lead
                to financial losses and diminished market competitiveness.</p>
