            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul class="key-concepts">

        <div class="theory-section">
            <h3>Transactional Leadership</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Transactional leadership is based on structured tasks and clear rewards or
                punishments. Leaders focus on short-term goals, efficiency, and maintaining order.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Many military organizations use a transactional leadership style due
                to its emphasis on structure, discipline, and clear expectations.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Transactional leadership is highly effective in stable environments where
                efficiency, routine, and consistency are crucial.</p>

                that employees are empowered and supported. The leader’s role is to serve the team, which in turn leads
                to higher engagement and performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>

                leadership approach by focusing on employee welfare, offering healthcare benefits, and promoting ethical
                sourcing of coffee.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Servant leadership enhances employee satisfaction, loyalty, and long-term

            <h3>Emotional Intelligence in Leadership</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Emotional Intelligence (EI) refers to a leader’s ability to recognize,
                understand, and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It’s critical for

            <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Oprah Winfrey is often praised for her emotional intelligence, which
                she uses to connect deeply with her audience and team, fostering an open and communicative environment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Leaders with high emotional intelligence tend to be better at managing
                teams, resolving conflicts, and creating a positive work culture.</p>
