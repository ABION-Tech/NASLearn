            <h2>Stages of Team Development and Group Dynamics</h2>
            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            <p>Teams go through distinct stages of development, as outlined by Bruce Tuckman’s model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Forming:</strong> Team members are polite, figuring out their roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Storming:</strong> Conflicts arise as personalities clash and power struggles occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Norming:</strong> The team begins to resolve differences, establish norms, and work more
                    cohesively.</li>
                <li><strong>Performing:</strong> The team reaches a stage of high performance and collaboration.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjourning:</strong> The team disbands after the project or goal is completed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Cohesion:</strong> How well team members work together.</li>
                <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Clarifying roles and responsibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Groupthink:</strong> The risk of conformity stifling innovation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <p>Project teams in consulting firms often move through these stages, initially struggling with conflict
                (storming) before coming together to deliver a successful project (performing).</p>
            <h4>Significance:</h4>
            <p>Understanding team dynamics helps leaders guide their teams through challenges to achieve higher
                performance.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conflict Resolution and Negotiation Skills</h2>
            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
            <p>Conflict in teams is inevitable. Effective conflict resolution requires active listening, empathy, and
                negotiation.</p>
            <h4>Strategies for Resolution:</h4>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Collaborating:</strong> Working together to find a win-win solution.</li>
                <li><strong>Compromising:</strong> Finding a middle ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding:</strong> Delaying the conflict if it’s not critical to address immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Competing:</strong> Standing firm on critical issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Accommodating:</strong> Yielding to maintain harmony.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Real-World Example:</h4>
            <p>In the tech industry, cross-functional teams often experience conflict between engineers and marketing
                teams due to differing priorities. Negotiation and collaboration help resolve these conflicts
                productively.</p>
            <h4>Significance:</h4>
            <p>Leaders with strong conflict resolution skills can manage tensions within teams, ensuring that conflicts
                don’t derail progress.</p>
