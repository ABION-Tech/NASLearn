            <h2>The Marketing Mix (4 Ps)</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The marketing mix refers to the set of controllable factors that companies
                use to influence consumer purchasing decisions. It is divided into four key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product:</strong> The goods or services offered by a business to meet consumer needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> The amount charged for the product, considering costs, competition, and
                    perceived value.</li>
                <li><strong>Place:</strong> The distribution channels used to make the product available to consumers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> The methods used to communicate the productâ€™s value and persuade
                    customers to purchase.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-concepts">
                <strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Strategy:</strong> Identifying the unique value proposition, design, and quality
                        of the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> Factors such as cost-plus pricing, value-based pricing, and
                        competition-based pricing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution Strategy:</strong> Choosing between direct or indirect channels, logistics,
                        and location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promotional Strategy:</strong> Advertising, public relations, sales promotions, and
                        digital marketing.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Example:</strong>
                <p><strong>Apple</strong> uses the marketing mix to market its iPhone. The product is designed with high
                    quality and innovation (<strong>Product</strong>), sold at a premium price (<strong>Price</strong>),
                    distributed through both physical stores and online (<strong>Place</strong>), and promoted through
                    global advertising campaigns and product launches (<strong>Promotion</strong>).</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The marketing mix allows companies to develop integrated marketing
                strategies that ensure all aspects of the product are aligned with consumer needs. By effectively
                managing these four elements, businesses can better satisfy their target market, increase customer
                loyalty, and achieve long-term success.</p>
