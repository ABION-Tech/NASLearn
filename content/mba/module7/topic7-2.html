        <h1>Corporate Governance</h1>

        <h2 class="section-title">Roles and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors</h2>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Corporate governance refers to the system by which companies are directed and
            controlled. The board of directors plays a critical role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and
            fairness in a company's operations.</p>

        <div class="key-concepts">
            <strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fiduciary Responsibility:</strong> Board members must act in the best interest of
                    shareholders and the company.</li>
                <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Ensuring that the company adheres to laws, regulations, and ethical
                    standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Executive Compensation:</strong> Deciding how top executives are paid, which must align with
                    the company’s long-term goals and shareholder interests.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
            <strong>Enron Collapse (2001):</strong> Poor corporate governance was a major factor in Enron’s downfall, as
            the board of directors failed to provide adequate oversight, enabling fraudulent financial practices.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The board of directors ensures that the company is managed effectively, aligns
            with ethical standards, and protects the interests of shareholders and stakeholders.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Standards</h2>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Companies are expected to comply with regulatory frameworks and ethical
            standards to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in business practices.</p>

        <div class="key-concepts">
            <strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Adhering to laws and regulations specific to the industry
                    (e.g., environmental laws, labor laws, anti-corruption regulations).</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Standards:</strong> Going beyond legal requirements to ensure fairness, respect for
                    human rights, and environmental sustainability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Real-World Example:</strong><br>
            <strong>Facebook and Data Privacy (Cambridge Analytica Scandal):</strong> Facebook faced heavy scrutiny for
            mishandling user data, prompting new regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the
            European Union to ensure companies prioritize user privacy.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Regulatory compliance helps companies avoid legal consequences, while ethical
            standards build long-term trust with stakeholders and contribute to sustainable success.</p>
    </div>
