        <h1>Operations Management Concepts</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Process Design and Improvement</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Operations management focuses on designing, optimizing, and overseeing the
                processes that produce goods or services. Effective process design ensures that resources are used
                efficiently, and operations are streamlined for maximum productivity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process Design:</strong> Involves defining workflows, selecting the right technology, and
                    organizing resources to create efficient systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Ongoing analysis of existing processes to identify
                    bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for cost reduction. Tools such as <strong>Lean
                        Manufacturing</strong> and <strong>Total Quality Management (TQM)</strong> are used to enhance
                    performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Lean Manufacturing:</strong> Focuses on minimizing waste without sacrificing productivity.
                </li>
                <li><strong>TQM (Total Quality Management):</strong> A comprehensive approach that involves every
                    employee in continuous improvement efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="real-world-example"><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <em>Toyota Production System (TPS):</em>
                Toyota revolutionized process design by implementing Lean principles to reduce waste, streamline
                production, and enhance product quality.</p>
            <p class="significance"><strong>Significance:</strong> Efficient process design improves quality, reduces
                costs, and enhances customer satisfaction, which is crucial for maintaining competitiveness.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Quality Management and Continuous Improvement Methodologies (e.g., Six Sigma)</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Quality management ensures that products or services meet customer
                expectations. Continuous improvement focuses on incremental changes that enhance quality, efficiency,
                and performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Six Sigma:</strong> A data-driven methodology that aims to reduce defects and variability in
                    processes, using tools such as <strong>DMAIC</strong> (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Kaizen:</strong> A philosophy that encourages continuous, small improvements in all areas of
                    an organization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Six Sigma Levels:</strong> The goal is to reduce defects to fewer than 3.4 per million
                    opportunities, aiming for near-perfection in processes.</li>
                <li><strong>PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Cycle:</strong> A continuous improvement framework that helps
                    identify areas for enhancement and systematically tests solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="real-world-example"><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <em>General Electric (GE):</em> GE
                successfully used Six Sigma to reduce operational costs by improving product quality and reducing
                defects, saving billions of dollars.</p>
            <p class="significance"><strong>Significance:</strong> Continuous improvement methodologies are essential
                for organizations to remain adaptable, reduce waste, and deliver higher-quality products and services
                consistently.</p>
