        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Components of Supply Chain Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Supply chain management (SCM) involves the coordination and management of
                all activities related to sourcing, production, and delivery of goods or services. A well-functioning
                supply chain ensures that products are delivered to the right place, at the right time, and at the
                lowest possible cost.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suppliers:</strong> Organizations that provide raw materials or components.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturers:</strong> Convert raw materials into finished goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributors:</strong> Handle logistics and deliver goods to retailers or consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Retailers:</strong> Sell products to end customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Coordination:</strong> Ensuring that each component of the supply chain
                    communicates effectively to prevent delays or shortages.</li>
                <li><strong>Demand Forecasting:</strong> Predicting customer demand to adjust production and inventory
                    levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="real-world-example"><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <em>Apple’s Supply Chain:</em> Apple
                manages a complex global supply chain that involves suppliers from multiple countries, contract
                manufacturers, and logistics partners, allowing them to quickly adapt to demand fluctuations and deliver
                new products worldwide.</p>
            <p class="significance"><strong>Significance:</strong> Effective supply chain management reduces costs,
                improves efficiency, and ensures that companies can meet customer demand in a timely manner.</p>

            <h2>2. Inventory Management Techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Inventory management is the process of overseeing and controlling the
                ordering, storage, and use of a company’s inventory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Just-in-Time (JIT):</strong> An inventory strategy where materials are ordered and received
                    only as they are needed, reducing storage costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):</strong> A formula for determining the optimal order quantity
                    that minimizes both ordering and holding costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li><strong>Safety Stock:</strong> Extra inventory kept on hand to mitigate the risk of stockouts due to
                    demand fluctuations or supply chain disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio:</strong> Measures how efficiently a company is managing its
                    inventory by calculating how often inventory is sold and replaced over a specific period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="real-world-example"><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <em>Walmart’s Inventory Management:</em>
                Walmart uses advanced technology for real-time inventory tracking, which enables them to replenish stock
                efficiently and keep inventory costs low.</p>
            <p class="significance"><strong>Significance:</strong> Proper inventory management ensures businesses can
                meet demand without excessive overstock, reducing carrying costs and improving cash flow.</p>
