        <h1>Global Business Environment</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Understanding Global Markets and Trade Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The global business environment involves a complex interplay of factors
                such as market dynamics, trade regulations, economic conditions, and political landscapes that influence
                how businesses operate internationally. Several trade theories explain why and how countries engage in
                international trade.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comparative Advantage:</strong> Nations should specialize in producing goods for which they
                    have a relative efficiency compared to other countries (David Ricardo’s theory).</li>
                <li><strong>Absolute Advantage:</strong> A country can produce more of a good using fewer resources than
                    another country (Adam Smith’s theory).</li>
                <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> The increasing interconnectedness of economies through trade,
                    investment, and technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Political and Economic Risks:</strong> Factors like trade barriers, exchange rates, and
                    political instability that affect international business.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <br>
                <strong>Apple’s Global Supply Chain:</strong> Apple uses a global supply chain for its iPhone, sourcing
                parts from several countries and assembling in China, taking advantage of comparative advantages in
                different markets.
            </div>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Understanding trade theories and global market dynamics helps businesses
                optimize their operations and take advantage of international opportunities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Cultural Considerations in International Business</h2>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Cultural differences can impact everything from negotiations and marketing
                to leadership and decision-making in international business.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions:</strong> A framework for understanding cultural differences
                    across nations, such as power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communication Styles:</strong> Direct vs. indirect communication, high-context vs.
                    low-context cultures.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Ethical norms and practices can differ widely between
                    countries (e.g., attitudes toward corruption or labor practices).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="real-world-example">
                <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> <br>
                <strong>McDonald’s Global Strategy:</strong> McDonald’s customizes its menu to suit local tastes, such
                as offering vegetarian options in India and rice-based meals in Japan, showing awareness of cultural
                preferences.
            </div>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Recognizing cultural differences is critical to successful international
                business, allowing firms to adapt their strategies to local markets and avoid misunderstandings.</p>
