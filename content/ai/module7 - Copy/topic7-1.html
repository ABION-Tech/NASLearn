            <h1>AI for Coding: A Revolutionary Tool</h1>
            <p class="custom-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has infiltrated various aspects of our lives, and
                software development is no exception. AI-powered tools are revolutionizing the way developers write,
                debug, and optimize code, making the process more efficient, productive, and innovative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>GitHub Copilot</h2>
            <p class="custom-text">One of the most prominent AI-powered coding assistants is GitHub Copilot. Developed
                in collaboration with OpenAI, Copilot uses a large language model to suggest code completions in
                real-time as developers write code.</p>

            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Contextual Code Suggestions:</strong> Copilot understands the context of your code and
                    suggests relevant code snippets, functions, or entire blocks of code.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Prompts:</strong> You can describe the desired functionality in plain
                    language, and Copilot will generate code snippets that match your intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning from Your Code:</strong> Copilot learns from your coding style and preferences,
                    providing more tailored suggestions over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>OpenAI Codex</h2>
            <p class="custom-text">Similar to GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex is another powerful AI tool for coding. It
                can generate code from natural language prompts or complete existing code snippets.</p>

            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Codex can generate code in various programming languages, making it a
                    versatile tool for developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Codex can help you solve coding problems by suggesting potential
                    solutions or code snippets.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning from Code Repositories:</strong> Codex is trained on a massive dataset of publicly
                    available code, allowing it to generate code that is relevant and efficient.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How AI Assists in Software Development</h2>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Code Generation:</strong> AI tools can generate code snippets or entire functions based on
                    natural language descriptions or code context. This can significantly speed up the development
                    process.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Completion:</strong> AI can suggest code completions as you type, reducing the need to
                    manually write every line of code.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> AI can help identify and fix errors in your code, saving time and
                    effort.</li>
                <li><strong>Code Optimization:</strong> AI can suggest ways to optimize your code for performance or
                    readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning New Languages:</strong> AI can help you learn new programming languages by
                    providing code examples and explanations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits of Using AI for Coding</h2>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> AI tools can help developers write code faster and more
                    efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Code Quality:</strong> AI can help identify and fix errors, leading to
                    higher-quality code.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Learning Curve:</strong> AI can help developers learn new programming languages or
                    frameworks more quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> AI can inspire new ideas and approaches to software development.</li>
