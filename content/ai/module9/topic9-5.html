        <h1>Practical Exercise: Auditing an AI Project for Ethical and Security Concerns</h1>

        <div class="content-section">
            <p>In this exercise, you will conduct an audit of an AI project designed to predict customer churn for a
                telecommunications company. The objective is to identify ethical and security concerns and ensure
                compliance with data privacy regulations while providing actionable recommendations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <p>You are tasked with auditing an AI project that aims to predict customer churn within a
                telecommunications company. Customer churn prediction models utilize historical customer data to
                forecast which customers are likely to discontinue their services, enabling proactive retention efforts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify potential ethical and security concerns in the project.</li>
                <li>Assess the project's compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.</li>
                <li>Provide recommendations for improving the project's ethical and security practices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Steps for Auditing the AI Project</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="accent">Understand the Project:</span> Gain a thorough understanding of the project’s
                    goals, data sources, and algorithms used in the customer churn prediction model.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Identify Sensitive Data:</span> Identify any sensitive personal data being
                    collected or processed, such as customer demographics, transaction history, and service usage
                    patterns.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Assess Data Privacy Compliance:</span> Evaluate the project’s compliance with
                    data privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA, including data subject rights and data processing
                    agreements.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Assess Bias and Fairness:</span> Analyze the data and algorithms to identify
                    potential biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, ensuring the model does not
                    disproportionately affect any customer group.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Security Assessment:</span> Evaluate the project’s security practices,
                    including data encryption, access controls, and incident response plans to safeguard sensitive
                    information.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Ethical Considerations:</span> Consider any ethical implications of the
                    project, such as the potential for misuse, discrimination, and the societal impact of customer churn
                    predictions.</li>
                <li><span class="accent">Provide Recommendations:</span> Based on your assessment, offer detailed
                    recommendations for improving the project’s ethical and security practices.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What type of data is being collected and used?</li>
                <li>How is the data being stored and protected?</li>
                <li>Are there any potential biases in the data or algorithms?</li>
                <li>How are ethical considerations being addressed in the project?</li>
                <li>What security measures are in place to protect the AI system and data?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Example Recommendations</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
                <p>Implement stronger data encryption measures and ensure compliance with relevant data privacy
