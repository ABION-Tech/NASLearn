            <!-- Chain-of-Thought Prompting -->
            <h3 class="mt-4">Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h3>
            <p>
                Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that guides AI through a logical reasoning process,
                breaking down responses into step-by-step explanations. This method is especially effective for solving
                complex problems in mathematics, logical reasoning, and decision-making.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourages structured, logical answers.</li>
                <li>Improves accuracy in multi-step reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>Enhances clarity in explanations, making them easier to understand.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> “What is 1248 divided by 6?”</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Response:</strong> “208.”</li>
                <li><strong>Chain-of-Thought Response:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“First, let’s break 1248 down: 1248 ÷ 6 means we need to check divisibility.”</li>
                        <li>“We start with 12 ÷ 6 = 2.”</li>
                        <li>“Next, 48 ÷ 6 = 8.”</li>
                        <li>“Thus, the final result is 208.”</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Few-Shot Prompting -->
            <h3 class="mt-4">Few-Shot Prompting</h3>
            <p>
                Few-Shot Prompting improves AI’s ability to generate responses by providing a few example inputs and
                expected outputs. This technique is valuable for text summarization, language translation, content
                generation, and data classification.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps AI learn the expected pattern of responses.</li>
                <li>Reduces the likelihood of irrelevant or incorrect outputs.</li>
                <li>Improves consistency in AI-generated content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prompt:</strong> “Here are two examples of news summaries:
                    <ul>
                        <li>[Example 1: ‘This article discusses the impact of climate change on agriculture…’]</li>
                        <li>[Example 2: ‘The report highlights new technological advancements in renewable energy…’]
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, summarize this news article: [Insert Article].
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Multi-Turn Conversations -->
            <h3 class="mt-4">Role of Context in Multi-Turn Conversations</h3>
            <p>
                In multi-turn conversations, AI needs to maintain context across multiple interactions to provide
                coherent and relevant responses. Explicitly referencing past interactions within prompts helps maintain
                the flow and consistency of conversations.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensures AI retains relevant information across interactions.</li>
                <li>Improves coherence and continuity in responses.</li>
                <li>Enhances user experience by making AI interactions feel more natural.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prompt:</strong> “In our last message, you explained why object-oriented programming is
                    important. Can you now describe its key principles?”
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Tools for Optimizing Prompt Performance -->
