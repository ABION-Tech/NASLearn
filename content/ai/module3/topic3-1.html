        <!-- Section: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -->
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2>
        </div>
        <p>One of the most powerful and widely used techniques for image generation is <span
                class="highlight">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</span>. GANs consist of two neural networks: a
            generator and a discriminator.</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Generator:</strong> This network generates new images based on random noise as input. Its goal
                is to create images that are indistinguishable from real images.</li>
            <li><strong>Discriminator:</strong> This network is trained to distinguish between real and generated
                images. It acts as a critic, evaluating the quality of the generated images.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The generator and discriminator are trained in a competitive process. The generator tries to fool the
            discriminator by producing more realistic images, while the discriminator attempts to accurately identify
            fake images. This adversarial process leads to continuous improvement in the generator's ability to create
            high-quality images.</p>

        <!-- Section: Other Image Generation Techniques -->
        <div class="section-title">
            <h2>Other Image Generation Techniques</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Besides GANs, several other image generation techniques exist:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data. They
                can generate images by encoding and decoding them.</li>
            <li><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):</strong> VAEs use probabilistic models to generate images based
                on a latent space representation, allowing for a variety of generated images.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow-based Models:</strong> These models learn a bijective mapping between the latent space and
                the data space, enabling high-quality image generation.</li>
            <li><strong>StyleGAN:</strong> A variant of GAN that employs a style-based architecture to control image
                generation, producing a wide range of styles and variations.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>
