            <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose an AI Tool:</strong> Select an AI-powered image generation tool, such as DALL-E,
                    Midjourney, or RunwayML. These tools can transform your prompts into stunning visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Define Your Brand Identity:</strong> Determine the overall tone, style, and values of your
                    brand. Consider questions like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What emotions do you want your brand to evoke?</li>
                        <li>What colors and design elements represent your brand?</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                    keywords or prompts related to your brand and product. For example, you might use prompts like:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>“natural facial cleanser, eco-friendly, green packaging, serene nature”</em></li>
                        <li><em>“skincare routine, refreshing, natural ingredients”</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Try different prompts, styles, and settings to produce a
                    diverse range of images. This step allows for creativity and refinement of the images to align them
                    closely with your brand’s identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Select the Best Images:</strong> Choose the images that best embody the essence of your
                    product and brand. Evaluate factors like visual appeal, relevance, and alignment with your brand's
                    messaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Edit and Enhance:</strong> Utilize image editing software to adjust the generated images as
                    needed. This may include cropping, resizing, color correction, or adding text overlays to create a
                    polished look.</li>
            </ul>
