        <h1>Types of AI: Narrow vs. General AI</h1>

        <h2>Understanding the Differences</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be broadly categorized into two primary types: <strong>Narrow AI</strong>
            and <strong>General AI</strong>. These distinctions are based on the scope of their capabilities and their
            ability to perform tasks beyond their specific programming.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Narrow AI</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform a specific task or
                set of tasks. It excels at solving well-defined problems within a narrow domain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited to a specific application or set of tasks.</li>
                        <li>Cannot generalize knowledge or skills to new situations.</li>
                        <li>Relies on pre-programmed algorithms and data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facial recognition systems</li>
                        <li>Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa</li>
                        <li>Self-driving cars (under specific conditions)</li>
                        <li>Medical diagnosis systems</li>
                        <li>Spam filters</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>General AI</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> General AI, also known as Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence
                (AGI), is capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks,
                similar to human intelligence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can learn and adapt to new situations independently.</li>
                        <li>Possesses self-awareness and consciousness.</li>
                        <li>Can perform any intellectual task that a human can.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hypothetical intelligent agents that can think, reason, and learn like humans.</li>
                        <li>Fictional characters from science fiction, such as HAL 9000 or C-3PO.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p><strong>Narrow AI</strong> is already prevalent in various industries and has significantly impacted our
            daily lives. Here are some prominent examples:</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI-powered diagnostic tools, drug discovery, and personalized treatment
                    plans.</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> Chatbots and virtual assistants providing customer support.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Robotics and automation for increased efficiency and productivity.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>General AI</strong>, while still largely theoretical, has the potential to revolutionize society in
            countless ways. However, its development poses significant challenges, including:</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Hurdles:</strong> Creating AI that can understand and reason about complex
                    concepts and abstract ideas.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Addressing concerns related to consciousness, sentience,
                    and potential risks of uncontrolled AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Societal Implications:</strong> Understanding the impact of AGI on employment, privacy, and
                    global security.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While <strong>Narrow AI</strong> is a reality today, <strong>General AI</strong> remains a distant goal. As
            AI technology continues to advance, the distinction between these two types may become less clear, and new
            categories of AI may emerge. Understanding these types and their implications is crucial for navigating the
            future of AI.</p>
