            <h2>The Challenges of Traditional Debugging</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging, the process of identifying and fixing errors in software code, can be a time-consuming and
                complex task. Traditional methods often involve manual inspection, trial and error, and the use of
                debugging tools. However, as software systems become increasingly complex, these methods can become less
                effective. Debugging often leads to frustration and can significantly slow down development, making it
                crucial to explore more efficient solutions.

            <h2>AI to the Rescue</h2>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating and improving the process of
                error detection and debugging. AI-powered tools can analyze code, identify potential issues, and suggest
                solutions, significantly reducing the time and effort required for debugging. By leveraging advanced
                algorithms and large datasets, these tools provide insights that traditional methods often miss.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key AI Techniques for Error Detection and Debugging</h2>
            <p>Some of the prominent techniques employed in AI-powered debugging include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Static Code Analysis:</strong> AI can analyze code without executing it to identify
                    potential errors, such as syntax errors, type mismatches, and code smells. This proactive approach
                    allows developers to catch issues early in the development cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Code Analysis:</strong> AI can analyze code as it is executed to identify runtime
                    errors, such as memory leaks, crashes, and performance bottlenecks. This technique helps in
                    understanding how the code behaves under different conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of
                    code to learn patterns and identify common errors. Over time, these models improve their accuracy
                    and relevance, adapting to the specific coding practices of a development team.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> NLP can be used to understand code comments and
                    documentation, providing additional context for error detection. By processing natural language
                    comments, AI can bridge the gap between code and documentation, enhancing overall comprehension.
