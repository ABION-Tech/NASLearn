            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Platform:</strong> Select a suitable chatbot development platform, such as <span
                        class="highlight">Dialogflow</span>, <span class="highlight">Microsoft Bot Framework</span>, or
                    a similar tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Define the Purpose:</strong> Clearly define the purpose of your chatbot and the types of
                    interactions you want it to handle. Consider the most common customer inquiries and the information
                    you want to provide.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Intents and Entities:</strong> Identify the main intents (user goals) that users
                    might have when interacting with your chatbot and define the relevant entities (e.g., products,
                    services, locations) that the chatbot needs to understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Build the Chatbot:</strong> Use the platform's tools to create the chatbot's logic. Define
                    intents and entities and write responses that the chatbot will deliver to users.</li>
                <li><strong>Train the Model:</strong> Train the chatbot's natural language understanding (NLU) model on
                    a dataset of sample conversations. Use various variations of user queries to improve understanding.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Test and Iterate:</strong> Test your chatbot in different scenarios to ensure it can handle
                    various user inputs. Make necessary adjustments based on the results of your testing.</li>
