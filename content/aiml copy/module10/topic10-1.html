        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction to the Capstone Project: Problem Definition and Scoping</h2>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1. Problem Definition</h3>
            <p>Defining the problem is the cornerstone of your capstone project. A well-defined problem sets the
                direction for your project and outlines its significance.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Identify a real-world problem:</strong> Choose a problem that intrigues you, ideally one
                    that can be effectively addressed using machine learning. Consider areas such as healthcare,
                    finance, education, or environmental science.</li>
                <li><strong>Define the goal:</strong> Clearly articulate the desired outcome of your project. What are
                    you trying to achieve, and how will success be measured?</li>
                <li><strong>Consider the impact:</strong> Evaluate the potential impact of your project on society or
                    industry. Will it solve a pressing issue or improve existing processes?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>2. Scoping the Project</h3>
            <p>Scoping helps define the boundaries of your project, ensuring that it remains manageable and focused.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Define the scope:</strong> Determine the boundaries of your project, including the data to
                    be used, techniques to be applied, and expected outcomes. Avoid overly ambitious goals that may lead
                    to frustration.</li>
                <li><strong>Set realistic goals:</strong> Set achievable milestones, considering available resources and
                    time constraints. This will help keep your project on track.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify potential challenges:</strong> Anticipate challenges that may arise during your
                    project and develop strategies to address them proactively.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>3. Dataset Collection</h3>
            <p>Data is the lifeblood of any machine learning project. Collecting the right data can significantly impact
                your model's performance.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Identify relevant datasets:</strong> Research and find datasets that relate to your problem.
                    Consider both proprietary and publicly available sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider data quality:</strong> Evaluate the quality of the data, focusing on completeness,
                    accuracy, and consistency. High-quality data leads to better model outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Data acquisition:</strong> Obtain the necessary data either by collecting it yourself or
                    leveraging existing datasets. Ensure compliance with any data usage regulations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>4. Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Data cleaning is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of your data for analysis.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Handle missing values:</strong> Address missing data using techniques like imputation
                    (filling in missing values based on other data) or deletion (removing records with missing data).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Remove outliers:</strong> Identify and remove outliers that can skew your data distribution
                    and negatively impact your model.</li>
                <li><strong>Correct inconsistencies:</strong> Ensure that the data is consistent and free from errors.
                    This includes standardizing formats and correcting typos.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>5. Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance
                of your model.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Create new features:</strong> Derive new features from existing data that can provide
                    additional insights and improve model performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Transform features:</strong> Transform features to a suitable format for machine learning
                    algorithms, such as normalization or encoding categorical variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature selection:</strong> Choose the most relevant features for your problem, reducing
                    dimensionality and improving model efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>6. Data Splitting</h3>
            <p>Properly splitting your data ensures that your model can generalize well to unseen data.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li><strong>Divide the data:</strong> Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to
                    ensure your model is evaluated properly.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure representativeness:</strong> Ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets
                    are representative of the overall dataset, maintaining the same distribution of classes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
