        <h1>Week 2: Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing Data Distributions and Relationships Between Variables</h2>

        <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the machine learning process. It involves exploring the
            data to gain insights, identify patterns, and uncover potential issues. Visualizing data is a powerful tool
            for EDA, as it allows us to see trends and relationships that might be difficult to detect through numerical
            analysis alone.</p>

        <h3>1. Visualizing Data Distributions</h3>
        <p>Understanding the distribution of your data is essential for understanding its characteristics and
            identifying potential outliers or anomalies. Various visualization techniques can help illustrate the
            distribution of numerical variables:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histograms:</strong> These show the distribution of a numerical variable, indicating the
                frequency of different values. Histograms help visualize how data is spread across different ranges.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Density Plots:</strong> Smooth versions of histograms, density plots are useful for visualizing
                continuous distributions. They provide a clearer representation of the distribution shape.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> These visualize the distribution of a numerical variable by displaying
                quartiles, median, and potential outliers, providing a summary of the data distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Violin Plots:</strong> Combining box plots and kernel density plots, violin plots offer a
                detailed visualization of the data distribution, emphasizing the density of the data at different
                values.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Visualizing Relationships Between Variables</h3>
        <p>Examining the relationships between variables can help identify patterns, correlations, and dependencies,
            leading to more informed analyses and decisions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scatter Plots:</strong> These illustrate the relationship between two numerical variables,
                helping to identify trends, clusters, and correlations.</li>
            <li><strong>Line Plots:</strong> These show the trend of a numerical variable over time or against another
                numerical variable, making it easy to visualize changes and patterns over intervals.</li>
            <li><strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Utilizing a color-coded matrix, heatmaps visualize the correlation between
                multiple variables, making it easy to identify strong and weak relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Pair Plots:</strong> These create a grid of scatter plots to visualize the relationships between
                all pairs of numerical variables in a dataset, providing a comprehensive view of interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interpreting Visualizations</h3>
        <p>To derive meaningful insights from visualizations, consider the following approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify Patterns:</strong> Look for trends, clusters, or outliers in the data that can inform
                your analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess Normality:</strong> Determine if the data follows a normal distribution or if it has a
                different shape that could influence modeling choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Detect Outliers:</strong> Identify data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the
                data, as these can impact analysis and model performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore Relationships:</strong> Analyze whether there are strong or weak relationships between
                variables, guiding further investigation and hypothesis testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choosing the Right Visualization</h3>
        <p>The best visualization technique depends on the type of data and the questions you want to answer. Consider
            the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> Determine whether your data is numerical or categorical, as this influences
                visualization choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Variables:</strong> Consider whether you are analyzing one, two, or multiple variables
                and select visualizations accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Research Question:</strong> Clarify the insights you aim to gain to select the most appropriate
                visualization techniques.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>EDA Tools</h3>
        <p>Utilizing the right tools can enhance your EDA process. Here are some popular libraries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> A powerful and flexible plotting library for creating a wide range of
                visualizations, suitable for basic to complex plots.</li>
            <li><strong>Seaborn:</strong> A high-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, offering a
                more user-friendly interface and enhanced aesthetics for visualizations.</li>
            <li><strong>Plotly:</strong> An interactive plotting library that supports various visualization types and
                allows for customization and exploration of data.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> By effectively using EDA techniques and visualization tools, you can gain valuable
            insights into your data, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions about your machine learning
            models. Engaging in a thorough EDA process sets a solid foundation for successful model development and
            deployment.
