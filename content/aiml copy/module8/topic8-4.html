            <h2>Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
            <p>
                Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the
                interaction
                between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques that
                allow
                computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, enabling a variety of applications that
                enhance user experiences across different platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The importance of NLP lies in its ability to bridge the gap between human communication and machine
                understanding, making it a crucial technology in today's digital landscape.

                <li><strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> Understanding the meaning of words and phrases in the
                    context of a sentence or document is complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Sparsity:</strong> Many languages have limited amounts of labeled data available for
                    training NLP models, impacting performance.</li>
