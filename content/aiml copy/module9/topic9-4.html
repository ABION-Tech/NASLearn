            <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
            <div class="important-note">
                <p><strong>Understanding AI Misconceptions:</strong> It’s crucial to address common misconceptions
                    surrounding AI to foster a more informed discourse about its capabilities and limitations.</p>
            </div>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">**AI is infallible:** AI systems are not perfect and can make mistakes. It's
                    essential to understand their limitations and biases, as errors can lead to significant
                    consequences.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">**AI will replace humans:** While AI can automate many tasks, it is unlikely
                    to completely replace humans. Instead, AI systems are best used to augment human capabilities and
                    assist in decision-making processes.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">**AI is always ethical:** AI systems can be biased or harmful if not
                    developed and used responsibly. Ethical considerations must be at the forefront of AI development.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Studies: Ethical Dilemmas in AI Implementation</h2>
            <p>These case studies illustrate the complex ethical dilemmas that can arise in the development and
                deployment of AI systems. It is essential to consider these issues and take steps to ensure that AI is
                developed and used responsibly.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>1. Facial Recognition and Privacy</h3>
                <p>Facial recognition technology has emerged as a powerful tool, yet its use poses significant ethical
                    questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mass Surveillance:</strong> The implementation of facial recognition for mass
                        surveillance raises profound concerns about privacy and civil liberties, with many fearing an
                        erosion of personal freedoms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Studies have shown that facial recognition systems can be biased against
                        certain demographics, leading to discrimination and unjust treatment.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>2. Autonomous Weapons</h3>
                <p>The development of autonomous weapons systems introduces grave ethical concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> The potential for unintended consequences and loss of human
                        control in warfare raises serious questions about accountability and moral responsibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Regulations:</strong> There is a pressing need for international
                        regulations to prevent the proliferation of autonomous weapons and ensure they are developed
                        responsibly.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>3. Job Displacement</h3>
                <p>AI’s automation capabilities can lead to significant societal changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Impact on Employment:</strong> AI has the potential to automate many jobs, leading to
                        widespread job displacement across various sectors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong> The economic repercussions of job displacement
                        necessitate policies aimed at retraining and supporting affected workers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Recap and Preview</h2>
            <p>In this week, we have explored the ethical considerations of AI and the importance of developing AI
                systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable. We have also discussed the potential impacts of AI
                on society and the need for responsible AI development.</p>

            <h3>Next Week: Capstone Project</h3>
            <p>In the final week of the course, you will work on a <strong>capstone project</strong> to apply your
                knowledge of machine learning and AI to a real-world problem. You will have the opportunity to choose a
                dataset, build a model, and evaluate its performance.</p>
