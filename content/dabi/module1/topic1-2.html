            <h2>2.1 Data Types</h2>
            <h3>Structured Data</h3>
            <p>
                Structured data is highly organized and easily searchable in databases by simple, straightforward search
                engine algorithms or other search operations. This type of data resides in fixed fields within a record
                or file, such as databases or spreadsheets. Examples include names, dates, addresses, and credit card
                numbers. Structured data is typically stored in relational databases and can be queried using SQL.
                Because it is organized and formatted, structured data is easier to analyze and integrate into BI tools
                and processes.
            </p>

            <h3>Unstructured Data</h3>
            <p>
                Unstructured data does not have a predefined format or organization, making it more complex to process
                and analyze. This type of data includes text documents, emails, videos, images, social media posts, and
                more. Unstructured data is often stored in its raw form and requires more advanced tools and techniques,
                such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, to extract meaningful information.
                Despite its complexity, unstructured data holds valuable insights and is increasingly important in areas
                like sentiment analysis and customer feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Semi-Structured Data</h3>
            <p>
                Semi-structured data is a hybrid that contains elements of both structured and unstructured data. It
                does not conform to a rigid structure like relational databases but has some organizational properties
                that make it easier to analyze than completely unstructured data. Examples include JSON, XML, and HTML
                documents. Semi-structured data is often used in web development and data integration scenarios where
                flexible data formats are needed.

            <h2>2.2 Data Collection Methods</h2>
            <h3>Surveys</h3>
            <p>
                Surveys are a common method of collecting structured data directly from individuals. They can be
                conducted online, via phone, in person, or through mailed questionnaires. Surveys are useful for
                gathering specific information from a large number of respondents. However, they can be prone to biases,
                such as self-selection and response bias.
            </p>

            <h3>Transaction Logs</h3>
            <p>
                Transaction logs record the details of every transaction made within a system. These logs can provide a
                wealth of structured data, including timestamps, transaction amounts, and user actions. Transaction logs
                are particularly valuable in retail and financial services for tracking sales, purchases, and financial
                transactions.
            </p>

            <h3>Social Media</h3>
            <p>
                Social media platforms generate vast amounts of unstructured data in the form of posts, comments, likes,
                and shares. Collecting data from social media requires specialized tools that can handle large volumes
                of text and multimedia content. This data is valuable for understanding customer sentiment, brand
                perception, and market trends.
            </p>

            <h3>Sensors</h3>
            <p>
                Sensors embedded in various devices collect data related to physical conditions like temperature,
                motion, humidity, and more. This data is often semi-structured and is used in industries such as
                manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation to monitor and control processes in real-time.
            </p>

            <h3>Public Data Sources</h3>
            <p>
                Public data sources include data released by government agencies, research institutions, and other
                organizations. This data can be both structured and unstructured and covers a wide range of topics such
                as demographics, economic indicators, and scientific research. Public data is valuable for benchmarking
                and augmenting internal data sources.
