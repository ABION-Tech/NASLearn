      <h1>Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing: Making Data-Driven Business Decisions</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div class="module-content">
      <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
      <p>After completing this lecture, you will be able to apply statistical analysis and hypothesis testing techniques to evaluate business scenarios, interpret statistical significance, and make data-driven decisions.</p>
      
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>In today's competitive business landscape, decisions based on gut feeling or anecdotal evidence can lead to costly mistakes. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft rely on statistical analysis to validate business strategies, optimize marketing campaigns, and improve product features. Understanding these statistical concepts empowers you to separate meaningful patterns from random noise and make decisions that drive measurable business results.</p>

          Understanding Data Distributions
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Imagine you're analyzing customer purchase amounts at your e-commerce store. Some customers spend very little, some spend moderately, and a few spend a lot. When you plot these amounts, they form a pattern called a distribution.</p>
          <p>The most common distribution is the normal distribution (bell curve), where most values cluster around the center, and fewer values appear at the extremes. Think of heights in a population - most people are of average height, with fewer very short or very tall people.</p>
          <p>Other important distributions include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Skewed distributions</strong>: Where data piles up on one side (like income distribution, where most people earn below average with a few high earners)</li>
            <li><strong>Uniform distributions</strong>: Where all values are equally likely (like rolling a fair die)</li>
            <li><strong>Bimodal distributions</strong>: With two peaks (like customer ages that peak for both young adults and seniors)</li>
          </ul>

          Measures of Central Tendency
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Central tendency tells us where the "center" of our data lies. The three main measures are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Mean</strong>: The arithmetic average. Add all values and divide by the count.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Business example</em>: Average order value in your online store</li>
                <li><em>Limitation</em>: Sensitive to extreme values (outliers)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Median</strong>: The middle value when data is ordered.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Business example</em>: Median household income in a target market</li>
                <li><em>Advantage</em>: Not affected by extreme values</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mode</strong>: The most frequently occurring value.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Business example</em>: Most common product category purchased</li>
                <li><em>Use case</em>: Useful for categorical data or identifying popular items</li>

          Understanding Variability
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Variability measures how spread out your data points are. Two datasets can have the same mean but very different spreads.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Range</strong>: The difference between the highest and lowest values.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Business example</em>: The gap between your highest and lowest priced products</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Variance</strong>: The average of squared differences from the mean.

                <li><em>Business example</em>: Variability in daily sales figures</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation</strong>: The square root of variance, in the same units as the data.
              <ul>
                <li><em>Business example</em>: How much customer satisfaction scores typically deviate from the average</li>
                <li><em>Rule of thumb</em>: In a normal distribution, about 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean</li>

          Understanding Relationships Between Variables
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>In business, we often want to know how different factors relate to each other. Does advertising spend correlate with sales? Does customer satisfaction correlate with repeat purchases?</p>
          <p><strong>Covariance</strong> measures how two variables change together:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Positive covariance: When one variable increases, the other tends to increase</li>
            <li>Negative covariance: When one variable increases, the other tends to decrease</li>
            <li><em>Business example</em>: The relationship between marketing spend and revenue</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Correlation</strong> standardizes covariance to a range of -1 to 1, making it easier to interpret:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1: Perfect positive correlation (as one increases, the other increases proportionally)</li>
            <li>0: No correlation</li>
            <li>-1: Perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases proportionally)</li>
            <li><em>Business example</em>: The correlation between customer service wait times and satisfaction scores</li>
          </ul>

          Understanding Statistical Significance with P-values
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>When we observe a relationship in our data, we need to determine if it's statistically significant or if it could have occurred by random chance. This is where p-values come in.</p>
          <p>A p-value represents the probability of observing your results (or more extreme results) if there were actually no relationship (the null hypothesis).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Low p-value (typically < 0.05): Suggests the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance</li>
            <li>High p-value: Suggests the observed relationship could easily be due to random variation</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Analogy</em>: Imagine you're testing a new fertilizer. If plants with the fertilizer grow taller, the p-value tells you how likely it is that you'd see this difference just by chance, even if the fertilizer had no effect.</p>

However, they might find no significant correlation between print ads and sales (high p-value), indicating that reallocating budget from print to social media could improve ROI.</p>

          <p>Hypothesis testing is a structured method for making decisions using data. It helps answer questions like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does our new website design increase conversion rates?</li>
            <li>Is there a difference in customer satisfaction between our two store locations?</li>
            <li>Does a new training program improve employee productivity?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The process involves:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Formulating a null hypothesis (H₀) - the default position that there's no effect or difference</li>
            <li>Formulating an alternative hypothesis (H₁) - the position we're trying to prove</li>
            <li>Collecting and analyzing data</li>

          <p><em>Types of t-tests:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent samples t-test</strong>: Compares means from two separate groups

          <p><em>Business case</em>: A retail chain wants to know if a new store layout increases sales.

          Understanding Confidence Intervals

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>A confidence interval provides a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter. It's more informative than a single point estimate because it accounts for sampling variability.</p>
          <p><em>Analogy</em>: If you're estimating the average height of all adult men in a country, you can't measure everyone. Instead, you take a sample and calculate a confidence interval (e.g., 175-178 cm with 95% confidence). This means that if you repeated this sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals would contain the true average height.</p>
          <p>The confidence level (typically 95%) indicates how confident we are that the interval contains the true parameter.</p>

          <p>Statistical significance tells us whether an effect is likely real (not due to chance). Practical significance tells us whether the effect is large enough to matter in the real world.</p>
          <p><em>Business example</em>: A large retailer tests a new checkout process and finds it reduces checkout time by 0.5 seconds on average. With a sample size of 100,000 transactions, this difference is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). However, is a half-second improvement meaningful to customers or the business? That's a question of practical significance.</p>

They must then determine if a 3-7 mmHg reduction is practically significant enough to bring the drug to market, considering factors like side effects, production costs, and existing treatments.</p>

          Understanding Linear Regression
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (the outcome we're interested in) and one or more independent variables (factors that might influence the outcome).</p>
          <p><em>Analogy</em>: Imagine you're trying to predict house prices. You might find that for every additional square foot, the price increases by a certain amount. Linear regression quantifies this relationship.</p>
          <p>The basic form of a simple linear regression is:</p>
          <p style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Y = a + bX + ε</p>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Y is the dependent variable (what we're trying to predict)</li>
            <li>X is the independent variable (the predictor)</li>
            <li>a is the intercept (value of Y when X is zero)</li>
            <li>b is the slope (how much Y changes for each unit change in X)</li>
            <li>ε is the error term (variation not explained by the model)</li>
          </ul>

          Interpreting Regression Coefficients
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>The coefficients in a regression model tell us about the relationship between variables:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intercept (a)</strong>: The expected value of Y when all X variables are zero</li>
            <li><strong>Slope (b)</strong>: The expected change in Y for a one-unit increase in X, holding all other variables constant</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Business example</em>: A regression model predicting monthly sales based on advertising spend might yield:</p>
          <p style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Sales = 10,000 + 5.5 × Advertising_Spend</p>
          <p>This means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With no advertising spend, expected sales are $10,000</li>
            <li>For each additional $1,000 in advertising spend, sales increase by $5,500</li>

          Understanding R-squared
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>R-squared (R²) measures how much of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>R² ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%)</li>
            <li>Higher R² indicates a better fit</li>
            <li><em>Business example</em>: An R² of 0.75 means that 75% of the variation in sales can be explained by the variables in the model</li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, a high R² doesn't necessarily mean the model is good or useful. It's important to consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The context of the analysis</li>
            <li>The complexity of the model</li>
            <li>Whether the model makes logical sense</li>

              <p>A subscription-based streaming service wants to understand factors affecting customer churn. They build a regression model with churn as the dependent variable and factors like:</p>

              <p>The model might reveal that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Each $1 increase in subscription price increases churn probability by 0.2%</li>
                <li>Each additional hour of content watched per month decreases churn probability by 0.5%</li>

                <li>Each additional month of account tenure decreases churn probability by 0.3%</li>
              </ul>
              <p>With an R² of 0.65, the model explains 65% of the variation in churn. This information helps the company focus on content production and customer service to reduce churn, while informing pricing strategy decisions.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>An e-commerce company has redesigned their product page to improve user experience and increase conversion rates. Before implementing the change sitewide, they conducted an A/B test where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Group A (control): 5,000 users saw the original design</li>
            <li>Group B (test): 5,000 users saw the redesigned page</li>

            <li><strong>Practical Significance</strong>: The 95% confidence interval (0.1% to 1.9%) tells us that we're 95% confident the true improvement in conversion rate from the redesign is between 0.1% and 1.9%.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Impact</strong>: For a website with 1 million monthly visitors, this improvement translates to:
              <ul>
                <li>Minimum expected additional conversions: 1,000 (1,000,000 × 0.1%)</li>

        <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
        <p>Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing provide a structured framework for making data-driven business decisions. By understanding distributions, relationships between variables, and how to test for statistical significance, you can move beyond intuition and make decisions based on evidence. Remember that statistical significance doesn't always equal practical significance—consider the business context and potential impact when interpreting results. The goal isn't just to find statistically significant results, but to generate actionable insights that drive business value.</p>
