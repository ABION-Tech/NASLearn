            <p>
                A local restaurant wants to attract more customers through digital marketing. They could utilize
                <strong>SEO</strong> to improve their online presence by optimizing their website with relevant
                keywords,
                local listings, and creating engaging content such as blog posts about their menu, cooking tips, or
                local
                food events. Additionally, they can implement <strong>PPC advertising</strong> to draw immediate
                attention
                to their promotions by creating targeted ads on platforms like Google Ads and social media. This
                strategy
                would help them reach potential customers who are searching for dining options in their area.
