                <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
                <p>Understanding the nuances of data preprocessing and EDA is crucial. Here are some common
                    misconceptions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data cleaning is a one-time task:</strong> Data quality can change over time, making
                        continuous monitoring and maintenance essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>EDA is only for data scientists:</strong> EDA is a valuable skill for anyone working
                        with data, including analysts, researchers, and business professionals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correlation implies causation:</strong> While correlation suggests a relationship
                        between variables, it doesn't necessarily indicate that one causes the other.</li>
                    <li><strong>More data is always better:</strong> Quality of data is as crucial as quantity;
                        poor-quality data can lead to misleading conclusions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recap and Preview</h2>
                <p>In this week, we have explored the essential steps of data preprocessing and EDA. We have learned
                    about:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handling missing data: Techniques to deal with incomplete data entries effectively.</li>
                    <li>Outliers: Identifying and managing outliers that could skew analysis results.</li>
                    <li>Encoding categorical data: Transforming categorical variables into numerical format for
                        modeling.</li>
                    <li>Importance of visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables to enhance
                        understanding and analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the next week, we will delve into the world of <strong>Supervised Learning</strong> and
                    specifically focus on <strong>Regression</strong> techniques. We will explore different types of
                    regression models, their applications, and the evaluation metrics used to assess their performance.
