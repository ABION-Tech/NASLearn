        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Introduction to Model Deployment: Flask and FastAPI</h2>
            <p>Model deployment is a critical step in the machine learning lifecycle that involves making a trained
                machine learning model accessible to users or other applications. This process encompasses packaging the
                model and its dependencies into a deployable format and hosting it on a suitable platform. Proper
                deployment ensures that your model can be effectively utilized in real-world applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>1. Flask</h2>
            <p>Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that is widely used for building web applications and APIs.

                    applications with minimal overhead.</li>
                <li><strong>Highly Customizable:</strong> You can easily extend Flask with additional libraries and
                    modules to meet specific needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Flask integrates well with other Python libraries, making it versatile
                    for various applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps to Deploy a Model with Flask:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a Flask app to serve as the web interface.</li>
                <li>Load the trained model into the app's environment.</li>
                <li>Define a route to handle incoming requests and return predictions.</li>
                <li>Use a web server to serve the model, making it accessible over the internet.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>2. FastAPI</h2>
            <p>FastAPI is a modern Python web framework that offers high performance and ease of use. It is particularly
                suited for building APIs quickly and efficiently.</p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast Performance:</strong> FastAPI's asynchronous nature allows for high-speed processing,
                    making it ideal for performance-critical applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic API Documentation:</strong> FastAPI automatically generates documentation for your
                    API, making it easier to understand and use.</li>
                <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming Support:</strong> FastAPI is designed to handle asynchronous
                    operations, improving efficiency in handling multiple requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps to Deploy a Model with FastAPI:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a FastAPI app to define your API endpoints.</li>
                <li>Load the trained model into the app.</li>
                <li>Define API endpoints for different functionalities (e.g., prediction, status check).</li>
                <li>Serve the model using a web server, allowing users to interact with your application.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Choosing the Right Framework</h2>
            <p>The choice of framework depends on specific requirements and preferences. Here are some factors to
                consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complexity of Your Application:</strong> Flask may be more suitable for simpler
                    applications, while FastAPI is advantageous for complex, high-performance applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong> FastAPI generally provides better performance for
                    applications that require handling many simultaneous requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Both frameworks are user-friendly, but FastAPIâ€™s automatic
                    documentation and asynchronous capabilities can simplify development significantly.</li>
            </ul>
