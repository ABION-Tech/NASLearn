    <h1 class="section-heading">Wrapping Up Week 1</h1>
    <p>This week, you embarked on an exciting journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. We
        explored foundational concepts, the evolution of AI, and the types of AI that shape our digital landscape today.
        By delving into machine learning's key approaches—Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning—you
        gained a clear understanding of how AI learns and adapts to solve problems.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2 class="accent-color">Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li><strong>AI Fundamentals:</strong> Understanding the basics of AI and its impact across various industries.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning Types:</strong> A breakdown of ML approaches, providing insight into how AI models
            are trained and used.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools and Setup:</strong> Installation and initial exploration of Python, Jupyter Notebook, and
            essential ML libraries like Pandas and Scikit-Learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Hands-on practice with Python and data manipulation using Pandas,
            preparing you for deeper explorations in the weeks ahead.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2 class="accent-color">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>As we move into Week 2, we'll dive deeper into supervised learning, focusing on real-world applications and
        practical implementations. You'll learn how to build simple predictive models, evaluate their performance, and
        improve them using data.</p>
    <p>Keep practicing your Python skills and familiarizing yourself with the tools introduced this week—they will be
        your foundation for the exciting challenges ahead!</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2 class="accent-color">Reflect and Prepare</h2>
    <p>Take some time to reflect on the concepts covered this week. Ensure your Python environment is fully set up and
        functional, and revisit any areas where you feel less confident. By solidifying your understanding now, you'll
        be better equipped to tackle the complexities of AI and ML in the upcoming weeks.</p>
