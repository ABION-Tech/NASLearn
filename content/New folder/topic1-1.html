                    Welcome to the world of Machine Learning a subset of AI, which focuses on training algorithms on
                    datasets to identify patterns and make decisions. Machine learning is at the core of most AI
                    applications, hence its rise in demand. It's the process of teaching a computer to make predictions
                    or decisions based on data.
                    This course is designed to equip you with
                    the essential Machine Learning skills needed by many tech companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the course, we’ll explore everything from Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning,
                    Deep learning, Neural Networks
                    and more. By the end, you'll successfully gain a solid foundation in machine learning and be ready
                    to apply the knowledge in a practical setting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The course is structured in a hands-on manner, allowing you to apply what you learn immediately
                    through coding
                    exercises and real-world projects. Our final goal is not only to teach you theory but to help you
                    build a
                    solid portfolio that demonstrates your skills to potential employers or clients.

                  <p>AI presents both exciting opportunities and complex challenges. Ethical considerations include:</p>
                  <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Bias in AI:</strong> AI systems can inherit biases from the data

                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Privacy:</strong> AI-driven surveillance and data collection can
                      infringe on individual privacy rights.</li>

              <p>
                In this course, we'll cover both front-end and back-end technologies, helping you become a
                full-stack
                developer by the time you complete it. We’ll take a step-by-step approach, starting with the
                basics before
                diving into more complex topics.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the end of this course, you’ll understand how all these pieces work together to build robust
                web
                applications, and you’ll have the confidence to tackle projects of your own. Whether your goal is
                to become a
                freelance developer, work for a tech company, or simply build your own personal projects, this
                course will set
                you on the right path.
