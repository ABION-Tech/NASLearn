    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a **fully edited, professional-level digital artwork** using Photoshop,
            Illustrator, or similar software. This project will integrate various digital imaging techniques learned in
            previous lessons.</p>
