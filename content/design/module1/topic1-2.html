            <h2 class="section-title">Design Elements and Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Understanding the Building Blocks of Design</strong></p>
            <p>Design elements and principles are the foundation of visual communication. Mastering these concepts
                allows designers to craft visually compelling, functional designs that effectively convey messages.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Design Elements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line:</strong> A <span class="highlight">line</span> connects two points, guiding the
                    viewer’s eye. It can convey energy, movement, and emotion, whether curved, straight, horizontal, or
                    diagonal.</li>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> A <span class="highlight">shape</span> is a defined area, either geometric
                    or organic. Geometric shapes like squares and triangles convey structure, while organic shapes feel
                    natural and freeform.</li>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> <span class="highlight">Color</span> is a powerful tool for setting tone and
                    emotion in design. Understanding color theory helps in creating contrast, mood, and harmony. Red
                    evokes passion, blue signifies calmness, and yellow brings energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Texture:</strong> <span class="highlight">Texture</span> refers to how a surface feels or
                    appears to feel. In digital media, texture is an illusion that adds depth and realism, while in
                    physical design, texture is tangible.</li>
                <li><strong>Space:</strong> <span class="highlight">Space</span> is the area around design elements.
                    Positive space is filled with content, while negative space gives the design room to breathe,
                    enhancing clarity.</li>
                <li><strong>Form:</strong> <span class="highlight">Form</span> adds three-dimensionality, making objects
                    feel solid through perspective, shading, or layer techniques.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Design Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance:</strong> The distribution of visual weight in a design. <span
                        class="highlight">Symmetrical balance</span> creates stability, while asymmetry brings dynamic
                    energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The deliberate juxtaposition of different elements (e.g., dark vs light,
                    rough vs smooth) to create visual interest and hierarchy.</li>
                <li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> Using contrast, scale, or color to direct the viewer’s attention to a
                    specific element or focal point in the design.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Lines and shapes can direct a viewer’s eye across the design in a
                    specific path, guiding them to key areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern & Repetition:</strong> Repeated use of design elements to create consistency and
                    rhythm. Repetition can bring unity, while patterns offer texture and interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> A sense of movement created through repeated visual patterns or elements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unity:</strong> The harmony of elements working together cohesively to present a seamless,
                    consistent message.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3 class="section-title">Expanding the Concepts</h3>

            <p><strong>The Golden Ratio:</strong> Designers often use the Golden Ratio (1:1.618) to achieve balanced and
                aesthetically pleasing compositions. It’s found in nature and used in everything from art to
                architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Color Theory:</strong> Dive deeper into the psychology of color. For example, brands use specific
                colors to influence perception. Red evokes urgency and passion, while blue signifies trustworthiness,
                frequently seen in financial institutions. Understanding the color wheel, complementary and analogous
                colors are crucial for harmonious design.</p>

            <p><strong>Typography:</strong> Typography is more than just choosing a font. Considerations include
                legibility, personality, and function. For instance, sans-serif fonts are modern and clean, whereas
                serif fonts evoke tradition and formality. Pay attention to kerning (spacing between letters) and
                leading (spacing between lines).</p>

            <p><strong>Design Styles:</strong> Minimalism is all about stripping away excess to focus on key elements,
                while Bauhaus emphasizes functionality and simplicity. Art Deco incorporates bold geometric patterns and
                rich colors, often seen in 1920s architecture and branding.</p>

            <p><strong>Design Software:</strong> Tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Figma, and Canva allow
                designers to bring their ideas to life. Photoshop and Illustrator are essential for manipulating images
                and creating scalable vector graphics, while Figma is gaining popularity for UI/UX design due to its
                collaborative features.</p>

            <p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Analyze famous designs like Apple’s branding, which emphasizes minimalism
                and user-centered design. Another great case study is Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign, which uses bold
                typography, contrasting colors, and emotive imagery to reinforce their brand message.</p>
