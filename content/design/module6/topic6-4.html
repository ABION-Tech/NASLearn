        <h1 class="text-center">Assignment: Designing a Mobile App Interface</h1>

        <h2 class="section-title">Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this assignment is to create a wireframe and high-fidelity prototype for a simple mobile app
            interface. This process will help you develop your UI/UX design skills and understand the key principles of
            designing for mobile applications.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Prompt</h2>
        <p>Choose a concept for your mobile app, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A to-do list app</li>
            <li>A social media app</li>
            <li>A news app</li>
            <li>A fitness tracking app</li>
            <li>A recipe sharing app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Materials</h2>
        <p>You can use the following materials for your design process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper and pencil for initial sketches</li>
            <li>Digital design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch for creating wireframes and prototypes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Steps</h2>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>1. Define the App's Purpose</h4>
            <p>Clearly articulate the app's goal and target audience. Consider what problem your app solves and who will
                benefit from it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>2. Conduct User Research</h4>
            <p>Gather insights into your target audience's needs, preferences, and behaviors. Use surveys, interviews,
                or user observation to inform your design decisions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>3. Create a User Flow</h4>
            <p>Map out the user's journey through the app, from initial launch to completing tasks. This visual
                representation will guide your design process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>4. Design the Wireframes</h4>
            <p>Create low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the layout, structure, and content of the app's screens.
                Focus on functionality and user experience rather than aesthetics at this stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>5. Iterate and Refine</h4>
            <p>Gather feedback on your wireframes from peers or potential users, and make necessary adjustments to
                improve usability and design.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>6. Create a High-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
            <p>Design a more detailed and visually appealing prototype that includes colors, typography, imagery, and
                interactive elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>7. Test the Prototype</h4>
            <p>Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback on the prototype's effectiveness. Observe
                users as they navigate through the app and note areas for improvement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h4>8. Iterate and Refine</h4>
            <p>Make any necessary adjustments to the prototype based on the testing results. Continue to refine your
                design to enhance the overall user experience.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Grading Rubric</h2>
        <div class="grading-rubric">
            <p>Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Does the app interface meet the needs and preferences of the
                    target audience?</li>
                <li><strong>Usability:</strong> Is the app easy to navigate and use?</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> Is the app visually appealing and consistent with the brand's
                    identity?</li>
                <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Does the app fulfill its intended purpose and provide the necessary
                    features?</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Is the app accessible to users with disabilities?</li>
                <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Does the app demonstrate originality and creativity?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Additional Tips</h2>
        <div class="additional-tips">
            <p>To enhance your design process, consider the following tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep it Simple:</strong> Avoid overwhelming users with too many features or complex
                    interactions. A clean and straightforward design is more user-friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize Core Features:</strong> Focus on the most essential features that align with your
                    app's purpose and target audience. Additional features can be added later as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Test on Different Devices:</strong> Test your app on a variety of devices and screen sizes
                    to ensure it works well on all platforms and provides a consistent experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek Feedback:</strong> Gather feedback from users and experts to improve your design.
                    Constructive criticism can help you identify blind spots and enhance usability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By following these steps and applying the principles of UI/UX design, you can create a user-friendly and
            visually appealing mobile app interface that effectively meets the needs of your target audience. Good luck
            with your assignment!</p>
