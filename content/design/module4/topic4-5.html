            <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
            <p>Branding is often misunderstood. Here are some of the most common misconceptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Branding is Only About Logos and Visuals:</strong> While visuals are crucial, branding
                    encompasses the brand's personality, messaging, and overall customer experience. It defines how
                    customers perceive the company.</li>
                <li><strong>Branding is Static:</strong> In reality, brands must evolve to keep pace with changing
                    market conditions and consumer preferences. A flexible approach to branding can help maintain
                    relevance.</li>
                <li><strong>Branding is Only for Large Corporations:</strong> Small businesses can also leverage strong
                    branding to differentiate themselves, create recognition, and build customer loyalty. A well-defined
                    brand can be a powerful asset for any business size.</li>
                <li><strong>Branding is Just Marketing:</strong> Branding transcends marketing; it’s about cultivating a
                    lasting impression and nurturing relationships with customers, fostering trust and loyalty over
                    time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <li><strong>Coca-Cola's Iconic Branding:</strong> Coca-Cola’s consistent use of its red can and

                    strategies focus on emotional connections and community.</li>
                <li><strong>Nike's "Just Do It" Campaign:</strong> Nike’s powerful tagline has established the brand as
