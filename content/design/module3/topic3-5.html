        <h1>Common Misconceptions and Case Studies</h1>

        <div class="misconception">
            <h4>Common Misconceptions</h4>
            <p><strong>1. Color is Subjective and Arbitrary:</strong> While individual preferences and cultural
                associations can influence color perception, there are underlying principles of color theory that govern
                how colors are perceived and interpreted. This means that certain color combinations can evoke specific
                emotions universally.</p>
            <p><strong>2. More Colors Are Always Better:</strong> Overusing colors can create a cluttered and confusing
                design. It's often better to limit your palette to a few carefully selected colors. A cohesive palette
                enhances brand recognition and visual clarity.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Color is Only for Aesthetics:</strong> Color plays a significant role in functionality and
                usability. It can help to guide the user's attention, convey information, and improve accessibility.
                Thoughtful color choices can enhance user interaction and satisfaction.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Color Blindness is Rare:</strong> Color vision deficiencies affect a significant portion of
                the population, and it's essential to design with accessibility in mind. Using tools to test
                accessibility can ensure designs are inclusive.</p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h4>Case Studies</h4>
            <p><strong>1. Apple's Use of Monochromatic Color Schemes:</strong> Apple has consistently used monochromatic
                color schemes in its products, creating a minimalist and elegant aesthetic. This strategy not only
                reinforces brand identity but also highlights product features.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The Pantone Color of the Year:</strong> The annual Pantone Color of the Year is a popular
                trendsetter that influences design across various industries. This color often shapes marketing
                strategies and consumer preferences for the year ahead.</p>
            <p><strong>3. The Use of Color in Branding:</strong> Companies like Coca-Cola and Tiffany & Co. have
                successfully leveraged color to establish strong brand identities. Their distinctive color choices help
                create emotional connections with consumers.</p>
            <p><strong>4. The Impact of Color on User Experience:</strong> Studies have shown that color can influence
                user behavior, such as increasing or decreasing conversion rates on websites. Understanding the
                psychological impact of color can drive better design decisions.</p>
