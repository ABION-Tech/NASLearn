            <h2>Understanding the Color Wheel</h2>
            <p>The color wheel is a circular diagram that organizes colors based on their hue, saturation, and
                brightness. It serves as a fundamental tool for understanding color relationships and creating
                harmonious color palettes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors because they cannot be
                    created by mixing other colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Orange, green, and purple are created by mixing two primary
                    colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color,
                    resulting in hues like red-orange and yellow-green.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
            <div class="color-scheme">
                <h3>Complementary Colors</h3>
                <p>Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. These create high contrast and can be used to
                    create bold and attention-grabbing designs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="color-scheme">
                <h3>Analogous Colors</h3>
                <p>Colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. They create harmonious and soothing
                    palettes, perfect for designs that need a calm appearance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="color-scheme">
                <h3>Triadic Colors</h3>
                <p>Colors that form an equilateral triangle on the color wheel. They create vibrant and visually
                    interesting palettes, making designs dynamic and lively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="color-scheme">
                <h3>Split-Complementary Colors</h3>
                <p>A variation of complementary colors where one of the complementary colors is replaced with its
                    adjacent color. This offers a balance of contrast and harmony.</p>

                with color vision deficiencies; use tools to check color contrast.
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> Don't hesitate to experiment with different color combinations
                and iterate on your designs based on feedback.

            <h2>Expanding on Color Theory</h2>
            <p>To deepen your understanding of color theory and its applications, consider exploring the following
                concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Gamuts:</strong> The range of colors that can be represented by a particular color
                    model, such as RGB or CMYK.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Management:</strong> The process of ensuring that colors appear consistent across
                    different devices and media, which is crucial in professional design workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Conversion:</strong> The process of converting colors from one color model to another
                    (e.g., RGB to CMYK), essential for print design.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Profiles:</strong> Standard profiles that define the color space of different devices
                    and media, ensuring accurate color reproduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Theory and Color Psychology:</strong> Understanding how these theories can influence
                    the choice of colors in design to evoke desired emotional responses.</li>
