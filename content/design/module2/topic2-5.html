            <div class="misconception-item">
                <strong>1. Typography is Only About Aesthetics:</strong>
                <p>While aesthetics are important, typography also plays a crucial role in improving readability,
                    conveying tone and mood, and strengthening brand identity. It serves as a visual language that
                    communicates the personality of the content.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="misconception-item">
                <strong>2. All Fonts Are Created Equal:</strong>
                <p>Different fonts have distinct characteristics and can evoke different emotions. Choosing the right
                    font for a particular project is essential. For instance, serif fonts may convey tradition and
                    reliability, while sans-serif fonts often appear modern and clean.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="misconception-item">
                <strong>3. More Fonts Are Better:</strong>
                <p>Overusing fonts can create a cluttered and confusing design. It's often better to limit your palette
                    to a few carefully selected fonts. A well-designed piece typically uses two to three fonts to
                    maintain coherence and harmony.</p>

            <div class="misconception-item">

                    and practice, anyone can enhance their design skills through understanding typography principles.
