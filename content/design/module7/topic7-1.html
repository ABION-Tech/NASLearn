                <h3>Understanding Digital Illustration</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Digital illustration is the art of creating visual content using digital tools and software. It
                    encompasses a wide range of styles and techniques, from realistic to abstract, and can be used for
                    various purposes, including graphic design, animation, and fine art. The flexibility and
                    accessibility of digital illustration make it an essential skill for modern artists and designers.

                <h3>Vector Graphics vs. Raster Graphics</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vector Graphics:</strong> Images composed of mathematical equations that define shapes,
                        lines, and curves. Vector graphics are scalable, meaning they can be resized without losing
                        quality, making them ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raster Graphics:</strong> Images composed of pixels, or tiny dots of color. Raster
                        graphics are not scalable and can become pixelated when enlarged, which can limit their use in
                        certain applications.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For digital illustration, vector graphics are generally preferred due to their scalability and
                    flexibility, allowing artists to create high-quality images at any size.</p>
