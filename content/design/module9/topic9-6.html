                components of a strong portfolio, including:</p>
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>1. Curating Your Portfolio</h4>
                <p>Curating your portfolio involves selecting your best projects and organizing them effectively. It's
                    important to choose work that not only showcases your skills but also reflects your personal style
                    and design philosophy. Aim for diversity in your projects to demonstrate versatility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>2. Project Descriptions</h4>
                <p>Writing clear and concise descriptions for each project is crucial. Describe the context, your role,
                    the challenges faced, and the solutions you implemented. Good project descriptions provide insight
                    into your thought process and demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>3. Visual Appeal</h4>
                <p>Creating a visually appealing and professional portfolio design is key to making a positive
                    impression. Use consistent fonts, colors, and layouts that reflect your personal brand. Ensure that
                    images and visuals are high quality and well-presented.</p>

                    <strong>Dribbble</strong> can greatly enhance your visibility. These platforms offer tools for
                    showcasing your work, connecting with other designers, and receiving feedback from a broader
                    audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="key-takeaway">
                <h4>5. Networking and Promotion</h4>
                <p>Strategies for sharing your portfolio and building your network are essential. Utilize social media,
                    attend design meetups, and engage with design communities online. Building relationships can lead to
                    collaboration opportunities and potential job offers.</p>

            <h2>Preview: Capstone Project</h2>
            <p>Next week, we will be working on our <span class="highlight">capstone project</span>. This will be an
                opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you have learned throughout the course to a real-world
                design challenge.</p>
            <p>The capstone project will involve:</p>

                    passionate about and how it fits into the broader design context.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="capstone-step">
                <h4>2. Conducting Research</h4>

                <h4>3. Developing a Design Brief</h4>
                <p>Outlining the objectives, target audience, and constraints for your project will help guide your
                    design process. A well-structured brief serves as a roadmap for your project and ensures clarity of
                    purpose.</p>

                    learning process. This is an opportunity to articulate your design choices and gather constructive
                    criticism.</p>
            </div>
