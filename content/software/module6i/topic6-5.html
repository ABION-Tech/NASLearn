            <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>

            <div class="misconception">
                <h3>1. UI and UX Are the Same Thing</h3>
                <p>While UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are closely related, they serve different
                    purposes. UI is primarily concerned with the visual elements and layout of a product, focusing on
                    aesthetics, buttons, icons, and overall design. In contrast, UX encompasses the entire journey a
                    user takes while interacting with a product, which includes usability, functionality, and
                    satisfaction. A successful product integrates both UI and UX to ensure that it not only looks good
                    but also provides a meaningful and efficient user experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="misconception">
                <h3>2. UI/UX Design is Only for Tech-Savvy People</h3>
                <p>This is a common myth. While some technical skills can enhance a designer's effectiveness, anyone can
                    learn the basics of UI/UX design regardless of their background. Many resources are available for
                    beginners, including online courses, tutorials, and communities that support newcomers. An open mind
                    and a willingness to learn are often more important than technical proficiency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="misconception">
                <h3>3. UI/UX Design is Just About Making Things Look Pretty</h3>
                <p>While aesthetics play a role, UI/UX design is fundamentally about functionality and user
                    satisfaction. A beautiful design that does not work well for users can lead to frustration and
                    abandonment of the product. Designers must balance beauty with usability, ensuring that the
                    interface facilitates the user's goals effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="misconception">
                <h3>4. UI/UX Design is a One-Time Process</h3>
                <p>In reality, UI/UX design is an iterative process. Successful designs require ongoing user feedback,
                    testing, and adjustments. As user needs evolve and new technologies emerge, designers must adapt
                    their approaches and continuously improve their products to stay relevant and effective.</p>
