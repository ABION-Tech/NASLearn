            <p>User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design are crucial aspects of product development. While
                often used interchangeably, they embody distinct philosophies that aim to create effective and enjoyable
                interactions between users and products.</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>UI (User Interface):</strong> Refers to the visual elements of a product, including layout,
                typography, color palette, and overall aesthetics. It focuses on how a product looks and feels, ensuring
                visual appeal and clarity in design.
