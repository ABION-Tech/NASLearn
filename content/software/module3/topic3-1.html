            <h2>Understanding Color Models</h2>
            <p>
                Color models are systems used to represent colors digitally. Different color models are utilized
                depending on the medium for color display or print. Each model has its own strengths and weaknesses,
                making it essential to choose the right one based on your design needs.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>RGB Color Model</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RGB (Red, Green, Blue):</strong> Used primarily for digital displays such as computer
                        monitors, televisions, and smartphones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Space:</strong> RGB colors are produced through a combination of red, green, and
                        blue light. Each channel ranges from 0 to 255, allowing for approximately <strong>16.7 million
                            possible colors</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vibrant Color Range: Ideal for digital applications, RGB produces a wide spectrum of
                                vivid colors.</li>
                            <li>Light Mixing: Colors are created by mixing light, which can lead to bright and luminous
                                effects.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Device Variability: RGB colors may appear differently across various devices due to
                                differences in display technology and settings.</li>
                            <li>Inconsistent Output: Colors may not match when transferred to print, leading to
                                discrepancies in design outcomes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>CMYK Color Model</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black):</strong> The standard color model used for color
                        printing, applicable to both offset and inkjet printing techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Space:</strong> CMYK colors are created by mixing cyan, magenta, yellow, and black
                        inks to produce a broad spectrum of colors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accurate Print Reproduction: CMYK is tailored for printing, providing reliable color
                                representation on paper.</li>
                            <li>Effective for Graphics: Ideal for designs that rely on rich, textured prints.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Color Variance: Colors may appear differently on screen versus in print, requiring
                                careful adjustments.</li>
                            <li>Limited Brightness: CMYK cannot replicate the brightness and vibrancy of RGB colors,
                                leading to more muted tones.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Choosing the Right Color Model</h2>
            <p>
                The choice between RGB and CMYK depends on the intended output of your design:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Digital Displays:</strong> Use RGB for designs intended for computer monitors, televisions,
                    or smartphones.</li>
                <li><strong>Print:</strong> Use CMYK for designs that will be printed on paper to ensure accurate color
                    reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some design software allows you to work in both RGB and CMYK modes, enabling seamless transitions
                between digital and print media.
