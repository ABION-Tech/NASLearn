            <h1>Color Theory: The Psychology and Application of Color</h1>
            <p>Color is a powerful element in design, influencing emotions, behaviors, and perceptions. Understanding
                color theory can enhance creativity and improve communication through visual means. This course explores
                the fundamental aspects of color, including its psychological impact and practical applications in
                design.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Color Wheel</h2>
            <p>The color wheel is a circular diagram that organizes colors based on their hue, saturation, and
                brightness. It is a fundamental tool for understanding color relationships and creating harmonious color
                palettes.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Types of Colors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> Red, yellow, and blue cannot be created by mixing other colors.
                        They are the foundation of the color wheel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Orange, green, and purple are created by mixing two primary
                        colors. They offer a wider range of choices for design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing a primary color with a secondary color,
                        these colors provide even more nuance and variation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
            <p>Color schemes help in creating a visual hierarchy and emotional response. Here are key types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complementary Colors:</strong> Colors opposite each other on the wheel (e.g., blue and
                    orange). They create high contrast and bold designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Analogous Colors:</strong> Colors next to each other (e.g., blue, blue-green, and green).
                    They create harmonious and soothing palettes.</li>
                <li><strong>Triadic Colors:</strong> Colors that form an equilateral triangle (e.g., red, yellow, blue).
                    They are vibrant and visually stimulating.</li>
                <li><strong>Split-Complementary Colors:</strong> A variation where one of the complementary colors is
                    replaced with an adjacent color, providing contrast and harmony.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Psychological Effects of Color</h2>
            <p>Colors evoke different emotions and impact perception in design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Energy, passion, excitement, but can appear aggressive.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Calmness, trust, reliability, but may seem distant.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Happiness, optimism, warmth, can be overly stimulating.</li>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> Nature, growth, harmony, refreshing and calming.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Royalty, luxury, creativity, mysterious and mystical.</li>
                <li><strong>Black:</strong> Power, elegance, sophistication, can also feel negative.</li>
                <li><strong>White:</strong> Purity, innocence, cleanliness, simple and minimalist.</li>
            </ul>
