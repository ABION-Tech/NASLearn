            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Brainstorm and Plan</h3>
                <p>Develop a concept for your magazine spread or product brochure. Determine the main message, key
                    points, and supporting visuals you want to include. Consider the emotions you want to evoke in your
                    audience and how your design can achieve that.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>2. Create a Wireframe</h3>
                <p>Sketch out a basic layout for your design, including the placement of headlines, subheadings, body
                    text, images, and other elements. This serves as a blueprint and helps in organizing your ideas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Choose a Grid System</h3>
                <p>Select a grid system that suits your design. Consider factors like the number of columns, margins,
                    and gutters. A well-structured grid helps maintain balance and harmony throughout your design.</p>

                <h3>5. Gather Visual Content</h3>
                <p>Collect images, illustrations, or other visuals that support your message. Ensure they are

            <div class="step">
                <h3>6. Arrange Elements</h3>
                <p>Place the elements on the page or spread, following the principles of layout design (balance,
                    contrast, hierarchy, etc.). Use alignment to create a sense of order.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>7. Refine and Polish</h3>
                <p>Review your design and make any necessary adjustments to improve the overall appearance and
                    readability. Pay attention to details, as they can significantly affect the final product.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>8. Print or Export</h3>

                    details are consistent across different media.</p>
