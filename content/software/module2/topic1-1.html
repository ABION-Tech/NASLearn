            <h2>History of Typography</h2>
            <p>
                Typography, the art of selecting and arranging typefaces, has a rich and fascinating history dating back
                to the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. Before the printing press, text was
                primarily handwritten or carved into stone. The development of movable type revolutionized the
                production and dissemination of information, leading to a proliferation of printed materials. The
                evolution of typography has played a critical role in the democratization of knowledge and the
                advancement of literacy.
