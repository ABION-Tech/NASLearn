            <h1>Typography in Layouts: Guiding the Viewer's Attention</h1>
            <p>Typography plays a crucial role in creating effective and visually appealing layouts. By understanding
                how to use typography to guide the viewer's attention, designers can enhance the readability,
                legibility, and overall impact of their work.</p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of elements in a design to create a sense of importance or
                prominence. Typography is a powerful tool for establishing visual hierarchy. By using different font
                sizes, weights, styles, and colors, designers can direct the viewer's eye to the most important elements
                of a layout.</p>

            <h3>Key Techniques for Using Typography to Guide Attention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger fonts are naturally more prominent than smaller fonts. Use different
                    sizes to create a clear hierarchy of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Bold or heavier fonts are more attention-grabbing than regular fonts. Use
                    bold fonts for headings and subheadings to emphasize their importance.</li>
                <li><strong>Style:</strong> Italics, all caps, or small caps can be used to create visual interest and
                    highlight specific elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Color:</strong> Contrast is key when using color to create visual hierarchy. Choose colors
                    that stand out from the background to draw attention to important elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Where you place text on a page can also affect its prominence. Elements
                    placed at the top or center of a page are generally perceived as more important.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Typography in Print Media</h2>
            <p>In print media, typography plays a critical role in ensuring that the content is easy to read and
                understand. Consider the following techniques when using typography in print layouts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line Length:</strong> The length of each line of text should be appropriate for the font
                    size and typeface. Too long or too short lines can make the text difficult to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Leading:</strong> The space between lines of text, also known as line spacing. Adequate
                    leading is essential for readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> The space between individual letters. Adjusting tracking can help to
                    improve the appearance and readability of text.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Typography in Digital Media</h2>
            <p>Typography in digital media presents unique challenges and opportunities. Consider the following factors
                when using typography on websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Ensure that your typography is responsive to different screen sizes
                    and devices. Use relative units (e.g., em, rem) for font sizes and spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Web-Safe Fonts:</strong> Choose fonts that are widely available on most devices to ensure
                    consistency across platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Use typography that is accessible to people with visual impairments.
                    Consider factors like font size, contrast, and readability.</li>
            </ul>
