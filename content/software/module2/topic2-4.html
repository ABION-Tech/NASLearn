        <h1 class="text-center">Assignment: Typographic Poster Design</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>To create a typographic poster for a fictional event using two contrasting fonts, emphasizing font
                pairing and hierarchy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Prompt</h2>
        <p>Choose a fictional event or theme for your poster. Consider factors such as the target audience, the overall
            mood or atmosphere, and the key message you want to convey.</p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Paper (white or colored)</li>
            <li>Pencil or pen</li>
            <li>Ruler</li>
            <li>Markers or colored pencils</li>
            <li>Computer with design software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Canva)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="steps">
            <h3>1. Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>Develop a concept for your fictional event. Consider the name of the event, the date, time, and location.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Choose Fonts</h3>
            <p>Select two contrasting fonts that complement each other and align with the mood and style of your event.
                Consider factors like serif vs. sans-serif, font weight, and x-height.</p>

            <h3>3. Create a Rough Sketch</h3>
            <p>Sketch out the basic layout of your poster, including the placement of the event information, the main
                headline, and any supporting text.</p>

            <h3>4. Design the Typography</h3>
            <p>Use your chosen fonts to create the main headline, subheadings, and body text. Experiment with different
                font sizes, weights, and styles to establish a clear visual hierarchy.</p>

            <h3>5. Add Visual Elements (Optional)</h3>
            <p>Consider adding simple visual elements, such as shapes, lines, or patterns, to enhance the overall
                design.</p>

            <h3>6. Finalize and Present</h3>
            <p>Refine your design, ensuring that the typography is legible and visually appealing. Present your poster
                and explain the font pairing and hierarchy choices you made.</p>
        </div>

                    elements.</li>
