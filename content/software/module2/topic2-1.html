            <h1>Software Development: Module 2 - Programming Basics</h1>
            <p>
                This module introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming, focusing on loops, conditionals,
                and functions. These concepts form the backbone of logical problem-solving in software development.

            <h2>Topic 1: Conditionals</h2>
            <p>
                Conditionals are programming tools that allow decisions to be made based on specific conditions. By
                using conditionals, programs can execute different pieces of code depending on the situation.
            </p>

            <h3>What Are Conditionals?</h3>
            <p>
                Conditionals are essential for controlling the flow of a program. They help implement logic by
                executing certain blocks of code only when a given condition is met.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Example:</strong> A basic program to check if a person is eligible to vote.
                <pre><code class="language-python">
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You cannot vote.")
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Syntax of If-Else</h3>
            <p>The basic structure of a conditional statement in Python is:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:  # Optional
    # Code block to execute if the elif condition is True
else:  # Optional
    # Code block to execute if all conditions are False
            </code></pre>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>if:</strong> Checks the given condition. If it evaluates to True, the associated code block
                    is executed.</li>
                <li><strong>elif:</strong> Checks another condition if the previous one was False. Multiple `elif`
                    blocks can be used.</li>
                <li><strong>else:</strong> Executes the default block of code if all preceding conditions are False.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use proper indentation for readability and to avoid syntax errors.</li>
                <li>Avoid deep nesting of conditionals. Instead, use logical operators or functions for better
                    readability.</li>
                <li>Use meaningful variable names to make the code self-explanatory.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 1: Grading System</h3>
            <p>A program to assign grades based on a student's score:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Example 2: Multiple Conditions</h3>
            <p>A program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
            </code></pre>

            <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to drive based on their age. (Assume the legal
                    driving age is 16.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a program that checks whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, divisible by only one of
                    them, or divisible by neither.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write a program that asks the user for their annual income and calculates the applicable tax based
                    on the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Income below $10,000: No tax.</li>
                        <li>Income between $10,000 and $50,000: 10% tax.</li>
                        <li>Income above $50,000: 20% tax.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
