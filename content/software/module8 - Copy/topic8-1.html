            <h1>Introduction to Motion Graphics</h1>
            <p>Motion graphics is the art of combining animation, video, and text to create dynamic and visually
                engaging designs. It involves bringing static elements to life through movement, creating a more
                immersive and impactful experience for the viewer. The evolution of motion graphics has transformed the
                way we communicate information and tell stories, allowing for a unique blend of creativity and
                technology.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Key Principles of Animation</h2>
            <p>Understanding the core principles of animation is crucial for creating effective motion graphics. Here
                are the key principles:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Keyframes:</strong> The starting and ending points of an animation
                    sequence, defining the key moments in the animation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tweening:</strong> The process of generating intermediate frames
                    between keyframes to create smooth motion. This technique saves time and enhances fluidity.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Timing:</strong> The speed and duration of animations, crucial for
                    setting the rhythm and pacing of the action.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Easing:</strong> The acceleration and deceleration of movement,
                    which creates a more natural feel to animations.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Creating a sense of preparation before an
                    action occurs, helping to inform the viewer of what’s about to happen.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Staging:</strong> Arranging elements in a way that is clear and
                    visually appealing, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Straight Ahead Action and Pose-to-Pose:</strong> Two common
                    animation techniques for creating movement, each with distinct approaches to motion creation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Exaggeration:</strong> Emphasizing certain elements to create a more
                    dramatic or comical effect, adding visual interest and enhancing storytelling.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Solid Drawing:</strong> Ensuring that the animation is grounded in
                    solid drawing principles, maintaining proportions and perspective.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Appeal:</strong> Creating designs that are visually appealing and
                    engaging, capturing the viewer’s attention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">“Animation is not the art of drawings that move, but the art of movements that are drawn.”
                – Norman McLaren</p>
