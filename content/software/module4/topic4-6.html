                    <strong>Brand Identity:</strong> Understanding the importance of creating a unique and memorable
                    brand identity. This involves defining the brand's mission, vision, and values that resonate with

            <h2>Preview: Layout Design and Composition</h2>
            <p>Next week, we will be exploring <strong>layout design and composition</strong>. These concepts are
                essential for creating visually appealing and effective designs. We will cover the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Principles of Layout:</strong> Understanding the fundamental principles of layout, such
                    as balance, contrast, hierarchy, and unity. These principles help in organizing content in a way
                    that guides the viewer's eye.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grid Systems:</strong> Learning how to use grid systems to create structured and organized
                    layouts. Grids provide a framework for aligning elements, ensuring a cohesive look.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Layout Techniques:</strong> Exploring various layout techniques, such as asymmetrical
                    balance, modular grids, and the rule of thirds. Each technique has its advantages depending on the
                    design objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Typography and Layout:</strong> Understanding the relationship between typography and layout
                    and how to use typography to enhance the visual hierarchy of a design. Good typography makes text
                    more readable and engaging.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>White Space:</strong> The importance of using white space effectively to create balance and
                    visual interest. White space helps to avoid clutter and enhances the overall aesthetic of the
                    design.
                </li>
            </ul>
