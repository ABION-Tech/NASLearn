            <h2>Steps to Design a Brand Identity</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Brainstorm Brand Identity</h3>
                    <p>Define the brand's personality, values, and target audience. Consider the emotions or
                        associations you want to evoke. For example, is the brand playful, serious, innovative, or
                        traditional? Create a mood board to visually represent these aspects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Develop a Brand Name</h3>
                    <p>Choose a memorable and relevant name for your fictional company. Ensure it reflects the essence
                        of the brand and is easy to pronounce and remember.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Design a Logo</h3>
                    <p>Follow the steps outlined in the previous section to create a logo that embodies the brand's
                        identity. Experiment with different styles and formats to find the most fitting design.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Create a Color Palette</h3>
                    <p>Select a color palette that aligns with the brand's personality and messaging. Consider color
                        psychology and how different colors evoke various emotions. Limit your palette to 3-5 main
                        colors for consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Choose Typography</h3>
                    <p>Select fonts that are appropriate for the brand's style and tone. Ensure readability across
                        different formats and consider pairing fonts for headings and body text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Develop Brand Guidelines</h3>

                        and imagery consistently across all platforms. This ensures brand integrity and recognition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Create Sample Materials</h3>
                    <p>Design sample materials such as business cards, website mockups, and social media posts. These
                        samples demonstrate how the brand identity is applied in real-world contexts.</p>
