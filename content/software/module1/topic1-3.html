        <div class="hardware-section">
            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p>Hardware plays a significant role in a designer's workflow. From powerful computers to specialized input
                devices, here are the key tools:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Computer:</span> A high-performance computer with ample processing power and
                    a high-resolution display is critical. Both desktops and laptops are suitable depending on mobility
                    needs.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Graphics Tablet:</span> This tool allows designers to draw directly on the
                    screen using a stylus for more natural control. Ideal for illustration, sketching, and digital
                    painting.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Digital Pen:</span> Paired with a graphics tablet, a digital pen offers
                    pressure sensitivity and tilt features that enhance the design process.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Printer:</span> A high-quality printer, preferably a laser printer, is
