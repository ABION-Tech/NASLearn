            <div class="sub-title">Core Principles of Software Engineering</div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>The foundation of software engineering is built upon a set of well-established principles that guide
                    the development process. These principles ensure that software is reliable, maintainable, and
                    efficient.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaking down a large software system into smaller, manageable
                        components or modules enhances code reusability, testability, and maintainability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details
                        promotes understanding and reduces complexity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Grouping data and the operations that act upon it into a single
                        unit protects data integrity and facilitates code organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Creating new classes based on existing ones promotes code reuse
                        and hierarchical relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Enabling objects of different types to be treated as if they were
                        of the same type enhances flexibility and adaptability.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="sub-title">Industry Trends Shaping Software Engineering</div>
            <p>The software engineering landscape is constantly evolving, driven by technological advancements and
                changing market demands. Here are some of the key trends that are influencing the field:</p>
            <div class="content-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> The shift towards cloud-based infrastructure has
                        revolutionized software development and deployment. Cloud platforms offer scalability,
                        flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it easier for businesses to develop and deploy
                        applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>DevOps:</strong> The convergence of development and operations teams has led to faster
                        software delivery cycles and improved collaboration. DevOps practices emphasize automation,
                        continuous integration, and continuous delivery to streamline the development process.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:</strong> AI and ML are being integrated
                        into software applications to enhance functionality and create intelligent systems. Natural
                        language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics are just a few examples of AI and
                        ML applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> The proliferation of connected devices has created
                        new opportunities and challenges for software engineers. IoT applications require robust
                        security, scalability, and real-time data processing capabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Code and No-Code Development:</strong> These platforms are empowering non-technical
                        users to create applications without extensive coding knowledge. While they may not replace
                        traditional software.</li>
