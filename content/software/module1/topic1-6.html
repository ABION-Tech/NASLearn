        <p>As we wrap up Week 1 of the course, youâ€™ve begun your journey into the world of Software Engineering and Front-End Development. This weekâ€™s focus on <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> has set a strong foundation for your future learning, and you now have the essential tools to build a basic web page.</p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">ðŸ“Œ Summary of What Youâ€™ve Learned:</h4>

        <h5 class="mt-3"><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong></h5>
        <p>HTML is the skeleton of a webpage. It provides the structure by using various elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and sections. Understanding how to organize content with HTML is the first step in web development. This week, you practiced creating your first webpage with simple yet powerful HTML tags to define content and structure.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3"><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong></h5>
        <p>CSS allows you to style and position elements on your webpage. You learned how to create visually appealing layouts, style text, and set colors. Furthermore, with responsive design principles, you can ensure that your webpage works seamlessly on different screen sizes. This is crucial for modern web development, where mobile-first design is a priority.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3"><strong>JavaScript Basics:</strong></h5>
        <p>JavaScript is what brings interactivity to your webpage. By the end of the week, youâ€™ve gained your first exposure to using JavaScript for simple tasks like form validation and handling user input. This programming language is key to making dynamic web pages that respond to user actions, and youâ€™ll dive deeper into JavaScript in the coming weeks.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3"><strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong></h5>
        <p>Learning how to design for multiple screen sizes is a game changer. With the use of media queries and flexible layouts, you now understand the importance of building websites that look great on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.</p>

        <h5 class="mt-3"><strong>Building a Portfolio Webpage:</strong></h5>
        <p>The hands-on project allowed you to apply your new skills to build a personal portfolio webpage. By the end of this project, you will have a simple yet professional website to showcase your journey as you continue through the program.</p>

        <h4 class="text-success mt-5">ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?</h4>
        <p>As you move forward, youâ€™ll continue to build on these foundational skills. Week 2 will dive deeper into advanced JavaScript concepts and explore how to work with modern front-end frameworks like React. The knowledge you gained this week will be essential as you move toward creating more complex, interactive, and dynamic web applications.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Remember, <strong>practice is key!</strong> Keep experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to reinforce your understanding. You now have the foundation to start building more advanced projects in the weeks to come.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info text-center">
          ðŸŽ‰ <strong>Congratulations on completing your first week!</strong> <br>We look forward to seeing your growth in the coming weeks.
