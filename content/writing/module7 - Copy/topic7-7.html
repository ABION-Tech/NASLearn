            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
            <p>Neural networks have a wide range of real-world applications across various industries. Here are some
                examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> Identifying objects, scenes, or features in images, such as
                    facial recognition and self-driving cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> Techniques such as sentiment analysis, text
                    classification, and machine translation.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Transcribing spoken language into text, enabling
                    voice-activated technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Suggesting products or content based on user preferences
                    and behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Applications include disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and medical
                    image analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Utilizing neural networks for fraud detection, risk assessment, and
                    algorithmic trading.</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Systems:</strong> Powering self-driving cars, drones, and robotic technologies.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Misconception 1:</strong> Neural networks are always better than traditional machine learning
                    models.</p>
                <p>While neural networks can be powerful, they are not always the best choice for every problem. Simpler
                    tasks or limited data may suit traditional algorithms better.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Misconception 2:</strong> Neural networks are black boxes.</p>
                <p>Though neural networks can be complex, techniques such as feature visualization and saliency maps can
                    help elucidate their decision-making processes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Misconception 3:</strong> Neural networks require large datasets.</p>
                <p>Large datasets can enhance performance, but techniques like transfer learning allow for effective use
                    of pre-trained models even with smaller datasets.</p>

            <h2>Recap and Preview</h2>
            <p>This week, we have explored the fundamentals of neural networks, including their structure, function, and
                training process. We have also discussed popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras for building and
                training neural networks.</p>
            <p>Next week, we will focus on <strong>Model Deployment and Real-World Applications</strong>. We will
                discuss the challenges involved in deploying neural networks in production environments and explore
                real-world use cases.</p>
