            <h2>Applications of NLP: Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis</h2>

            <h3>1. Text Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Text classification is the process of assigning categories or labels to a piece of text based on its
                content. This technique is essential for various applications in todayâ€™s digital world. Key applications
                of text classification include:
            </p>
            <ul class="technique-list">
                <li><strong>Spam Filtering:</strong> Identifying and filtering out spam emails from legitimate
                    correspondence.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Determining whether the sentiment expressed in a text is
                    positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Topic Modeling:</strong> Identifying the main topics or themes present in a collection of

            <h2>Techniques for Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                There are several techniques used in text classification and sentiment analysis that help in extracting
                meaningful information from text. These include:
            </p>
            <ul class="technique-list">
                <li><strong>Bag-of-Words:</strong> A simple representation where text is converted into a numerical
                    vector based on word frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>TF-IDF:</strong> A method that weighs words based on their frequency in a document and
                    rarity across the entire corpus, highlighting important terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Word Embeddings:</strong> Techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe that represent words as dense
                    vectors in a continuous space, capturing semantic relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> Various algorithms used for classification include:
                    <ul class="challenge-list">
                        <li>Naive Bayes</li>
                        <li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</li>
                        <li>Decision Trees</li>
                        <li>Random Forests</li>
