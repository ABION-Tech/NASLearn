            <h2>Assignment: Sentence Rewriting</h2>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Transform poorly written sentences into clear and grammatically correct ones.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <p>1. <strong>Rewrite the following sentences:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> *The report was written by John and is being reviewed by Sarah.*<br>
                    <strong>Error:</strong> Overuse of passive voice.<br>
                    <strong>Rewrite:</strong> John wrote the report, and Sarah is reviewing it.<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Rewriting in active voice makes the sentence clearer and more concise.
                    Active voice gives a direct, straightforward approach to communication.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> *During the meeting, we discussed project updates, however, we didn’t
                    make any decisions.*<br>
                    <strong>Error:</strong> Incorrect use of a comma instead of a semicolon before "however."<br>
                    <strong>Rewrite:</strong> During the meeting, we discussed project updates; however, we didn’t make
                    any decisions.<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> A semicolon is necessary to separate two independent clauses when
                    using "however." This helps avoid comma splices and ensures proper sentence structure.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> *He don’t have no idea about the new policies.*<br>
                    <strong>Error:</strong> Double negative and incorrect verb form.<br>
                    <strong>Rewrite:</strong> He doesn’t have any idea about the new policies.<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Corrected the double negative ("don’t" and "no") to avoid confusion
                    and used the appropriate conjugation of "do" for the third-person singular subject ("doesn't").
                </li>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> *The cake baked by my sister, it was delicious.*<br>
                    <strong>Error:</strong> Sentence fragment due to a misplaced clause.<br>
                    <strong>Rewrite:</strong> The cake baked by my sister was delicious.<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Removing the comma and connecting the subject with the predicate makes
                    the sentence grammatically complete. The sentence now properly expresses a single, coherent thought.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Original:</strong> *I have went to the store already.*<br>
                    <strong>Error:</strong> Incorrect verb form ("went" instead of "gone").<br>
                    <strong>Rewrite:</strong> I have gone to the store already.<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> "Gone" is the correct past participle form of "go" used with the
                    present perfect tense ("have gone"), whereas "went" is the simple past tense, which doesn’t work
                    with "have."
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>2. <strong>For each correction:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highlight the grammar error.</li>
                <li>Explain why the change improves the sentence.</li>
            </ul>
