            <h2>1. Resume Building with a Focus on ML Projects</h2>
            <p>Your resume is your first impression on potential employers. Here are strategies to make it stand out:
            </p>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>Highlight relevant skills:</strong> Emphasize technical skills related to machine learning,
                    such as proficiency in programming languages (Python, R), frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and
                    libraries (scikit-learn, pandas). Include soft skills like problem-solving and teamwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantify achievements:</strong> Use metrics to showcase the impact of your projects. For
                    example, “Improved model accuracy by 20%” or “Analyzed data from 10,000+ entries, leading to
                    actionable insights that increased sales by 15%.”</li>
                <li><strong>Tailor your resume:</strong> Customize your resume for each job application, emphasizing the
                    most relevant skills and experiences that align with the job description. Use keywords from the job
                    listing to pass through applicant tracking systems (ATS).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Interview Preparation</h2>
            <p>Preparing for interviews is key to successfully landing a position. Focus on the following areas:</p>
            <h4>Common ML Interview Questions:</h4>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.</li>
                <li>What is the bias-variance trade-off?</li>
                <li>How do you handle missing data in your datasets?</li>
                <li>Describe the steps involved in building a machine learning model.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Coding Challenges:</h4>
            <p>Practice coding challenges related to machine learning, such as implementing algorithms (e.g., decision
                trees, neural networks) or solving data analysis problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.</p>
            <h4>Behavioral Questions:</h4>
            <p>Prepare answers to behavioral questions that assess your problem-solving skills, teamwork abilities, and
                communication skills. Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to structure your responses.
