            <h1>Week 6: Advanced Supervised Learning - Ensemble Methods</h1>
            <h2>Introduction to Ensemble Methods</h2>
            <p>**Ensemble methods** are powerful techniques in machine learning that combine the predictions from
                multiple models to enhance overall performance. The primary advantages of ensemble methods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing overfitting, thus leading to better generalization on unseen data.</li>
                <li>Improving accuracy through diverse model contributions.</li>
                <li>Increasing robustness against outliers and noise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By harnessing the strengths of various models, ensemble methods can yield more reliable predictions
                compared to individual models.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)</h3>
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Bagging works by creating multiple models trained on different subsets of the
                data, known as bootstrap samples, and aggregating their predictions to form a final output.</p>
            <p><strong>Random Forest:</strong> A widely used bagging algorithm that employs decision trees as its base
                learners, offering exceptional performance in various applications.</p>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mitigates overfitting through averaging predictions.</li>
                <li>Accommodates both numerical and categorical features.</li>
                <li>Effectively captures complex, non-linear relationships in the data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Computationally intensive, particularly for large datasets with many features.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>2. Boosting</h3>
            <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Boosting constructs multiple models sequentially, where each new model focuses
                on the errors made by the previous ones, progressively enhancing model accuracy.</p>
            <h4>Types:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):</strong> Adjusts the weights of training examples based on
                    their classification performance, giving more focus to hard-to-classify instances.</li>
                <li><strong>Gradient Boosting:</strong> Iteratively fits new models to the residuals of the existing
                    model, optimizing a chosen loss function at each step.</li>
                <li><strong>XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting):</strong> An optimized version of gradient boosting that
                    incorporates regularization and other enhancements for improved performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieves high accuracy, especially in complex classification and regression problems.</li>
                <li>Handles both numerical and categorical data effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prone to overfitting if hyperparameters are not carefully tuned and optimized.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Ensemble Methods vs. Single Models</h3>
            <p>When comparing ensemble methods to single models, consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ensemble methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can significantly enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.</li>
                        <li>Effective for capturing complex relationships in the data.</li>
                        <li>May incur higher computational costs due to multiple models.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Single models:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simpler to implement and interpret.</li>
                        <li>May suffice for less complex problems, where the data is straightforward.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Choosing the Right Ensemble Method</h3>
            <p>Selecting the appropriate ensemble method hinges on various factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Complexity:</strong> Ensemble methods are generally more effective for intricate
                    problems that involve complex relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Resources:</strong> Consider the computational cost associated with ensemble
                    methods, especially with larger datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> While ensemble methods may provide better accuracy, they can also
                    be more challenging to interpret compared to single models.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section important">
            <h3>Practical Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Experiment with various ensemble methods and their hyperparameters to determine the best fit for
                    your specific dataset.</li>
                <li>Evaluate the performance of your ensemble model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy,
                    precision, recall, or F1 score.</li>
                <li>Weigh the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability when choosing between ensemble and single
                    models.</li>
            </ul>
