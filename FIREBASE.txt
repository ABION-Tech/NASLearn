Okay, so you're using GitHub for hosting your website and you've connected a custom domain. Now you want to add authentication to your site using Firebase. That's a great idea! Firebase Authentication makes it super easy to add secure sign-in to your website.

Here's how you can get started:

Set up Firebase Authentication:

If you haven't already, create a Firebase project.

Go to the Firebase console and navigate to the "Authentication" section.

Enable the authentication methods you want to use (like email/password, Google Sign-In, etc.).

Integrate Firebase Authentication into your GitHub project:

Install the Firebase SDK: You'll need to install the Firebase SDK for your chosen programming language (JavaScript, Python, etc.). You can find instructions on the Firebase documentation.

Initialize Firebase: In your project's main file, initialize Firebase with your project's configuration. You can find your project's configuration in the Firebase console.

Implement Authentication: Use the Firebase SDK to implement the authentication methods you enabled in step 1. For example, to implement email/password authentication, you would use the signInWithEmailAndPassword method.

Connect your custom domain:

In the Firebase console, go to the "Authentication" section and click on the "Authorized domains" tab.

Add your custom domain to the list of authorized domains. This ensures that users can sign in from your website.

Test your authentication:

Once you've implemented authentication, test it thoroughly to make sure it's working correctly.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement email/password authentication in your GitHub project using JavaScript:

// Initialize Firebase
const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase project configuration
};
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Get a reference to the authentication service
const auth = firebase.auth();

// Sign in with email and password
const signInWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) => {
  auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .then((userCredential) => {
      // User signed in successfully
      const user = userCredential.user;
      console.log("User signed in:", user);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle errors
      console.error("Error signing in:", error);
    });
};

// Sign up with email and password
const createUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email, password) => {
  auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .then((userCredential) => {
      // User created successfully
      const user = userCredential.user;
      console.log("User created:", user);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle errors
      console.error("Error creating user:", error);
    });
};

Remember: This is just a basic example. You'll need to adapt it to your specific project requirements.
