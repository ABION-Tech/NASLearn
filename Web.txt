Based on the images shown, I can identify several key technologies and tools used to create this modern-looking website:

1. Code Editor:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can be seen in the left part of the images

2. Frontend Technologies visible in the code:
- HTML
- CSS (with custom classes and styling)
- Appears to be using CSS transitions (visible in the code: `transition: color 0.3s ease`)

3. UI Framework & Components:
- Bootstrap appears to be in use (visible in the browser tabs "Bootstrap-Modal")
- Modern looking components like cards, buttons, and navigation elements suggest Bootstrap usage

4. Design Elements:
- Gold and black color scheme
- Modern typography
- Responsive design elements
- Use of icons and SVG graphics (like the university logo/shield)
- Gradient and overlay effects
- Card-based layout for features

5. Additional Features:
- Social media integration (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram icons visible)
- Modern navigation menu
- Responsive layout structure

To create a similar modern website, you would need:

1. Frontend Framework:
- Bootstrap or similar CSS framework
- Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Angular)

2. Additional Tools:
- A CSS preprocessor (SASS/SCSS) for better styling organization
- Version control (Git - visible in the VS Code interface)
- A good code editor (VS Code as shown)
- Image optimization tools for graphics and icons

The site demonstrates modern web design principles with:
- Clean typography
- Ample white space
- Clear hierarchy
- High contrast
- Responsive design
- Interactive elements
- Professional branding elements

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the tech stack or create a sample code structure for a similar modern website?

Ah, I understand - you're committed to the name and working with limited resources. Let's create a practical strategy that costs little to nothing while building towards future growth:

1. Immediate Free Improvements:

- Keep using GitHub Pages but optimize it:
  * Create a custom 404 page
  * Add proper meta tags for SEO
  * Ensure your site is mobile-responsive
  * Use your GitHub URL consistently across all platforms

2. Free Marketing Strategy:

a) Social Media Optimization
- Add "official" to your social handles (e.g., @NewAgeUniversityOfficial)
- Use consistent branding across all platforms
- Pin location to differentiate from competitors
- Add clear website links in all bios

b) Content Marketing (Free):
- Start a Medium blog
- Create educational content on LinkedIn
- Make tutorial videos on YouTube
- Share student success stories
- Engage in relevant Twitter/LinkedIn tech discussions

3. Technical Improvements (Free):

Let me create a quick checklist of free technical improvements you can make right now:

4. Free Tools to Help Compete:
- Google Search Console (free SEO tools)
- Google Analytics (free analytics)
- Canva free tier (for social media graphics)
- GitHub Pages features (for hosting)
- Free tier of CloudFlare (for CDN & security)

5. Differentiation Strategy (No Cost):
- Focus on personal touch
- Showcase your teaching methodology
- Create student community on Discord (free)
- Offer free mini-workshops
- Create detailed course roadmaps

6. Domain Strategy Until Funded:
- Use a consistent format: newageuniversity.github.io
- Add "Official Site" to your title tags
- Create a banner stating "Official GitHub Educational Platform"
- Use this temporary situation as a selling point ("Built by developers, for developers")

7. Building Trust Without a Domain:
- Be transparent about being a startup
- Show behind-the-scenes of course development
- Create detailed course syllabi
- Share student progress publicly
- Build connections with tech companies

8. Future Funding Ideas:
- Create a free intro course to build audience
- Set up early-bird registration with special pricing
- Consider crowdfunding for domain/hosting
- Look for educational tech grants
- Partner with other coding bootcamps

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide specific implementation details for any of them? I can also help create templates for social media posts or content strategy if needed.

Remember: Many successful tech education platforms started small. Focus on building quality content and community first - the domain and fancy website can come later as you grow.
