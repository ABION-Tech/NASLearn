Add interactivity to your prototype to demonstrate basic navigation.
Link your wireframes to create clickable interactions, simulating the user journey between pages.
Include notes explaining design decisions and any feedback incorporated.
Explain why you chose specific design elements, how you structured the layout, and any changes made based on feedback.
Key Takeaways:
Wireframing is an essential tool for planning the structure and functionality of your design before diving into visuals.
Prototyping allows you to test and refine interactions, ensuring your design is intuitive and user-friendly.
Iterative Design is key: Use wireframes and prototypes as tools to gather feedback and improve the user experience continuously.
